"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A court has ordered pop singer Britney Spears to give up custody of her children effective Wednesday at noon. Kevin Federline and Britney Spears, here during happier times, have two children. Spears' former husband, Kevin Federline, is to retain custody of their two sons ""until further order of the court,"" according to a ruling by Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon. It was not clear what led to Monday's decision awarding Federline full custody. A transcript of the court proceedings was ordered sealed. Last month, a judge ordered Spears, 25, to submit to random drug tests after finding she engaged in ""habitual, frequent, and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol."" That order, also by Gordon, provided no details and did not name any drugs. The former couple has been embroiled in a bitter custody fight over their sons, Sean Preston and Jayden. The parents had split custody 50-50, but Federline then asked for the arrangements to be shifted to 70-30 in his favor. Watch how Spears became user of -- and prisoner to -- fame » . In addition to ordering the twice-weekly drug tests, Gordon ordered Spears to spend eight hours per week working with a ""parenting coach,"" who was to observe her interactions with her children. Gordon also told both parents to avoid alcohol or ""other non-prescription controlled substances"" 12 hours before taking custody of the children. He also barred the exes from making ""derogatory remarks about the other party and the other party's family or significant other"" during the case. And he ordered the parents to go through ""joint co-parenting counseling"" and barred them from using corporal punishment on the boys. Spears and Federline were married for two years before their divorce became final in July. Monday's order comes amid a career freefall for Spears, whose new album is due to be released November 13. After her September 9 ""comeback"" performance on the MTV Video Music Awards, critics derided her singing and dancing as lackluster and said she appeared overweight in her sequined two-piece costume. Her former divorce lawyer, Laura Wasser, resigned last month as her legal representative after telling reporters the singer ""just wants to be a mom."" Spears' management company, the Firm, recently quit after representing the singer for little over a month. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- National Hurricane Center director Bill Proenza left his position Monday, just days after nearly half of the NHC staff signed a petition calling for his ouster. Hurricane Center Bill Proenza left his job as director Monday. Proenza is still employed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- a parent organization of the NHC -- but he is currently on leave, said NOAA spokesman Anson Franklin. Deputy Director Ed Rappaport has been temporarily placed in charge. Proenza, 62, became the director in January after the retirement of Max Mayfield. Proenza caused an uproar last month with comments about a key hurricane satellite called QuikSCAT. The satellite is five years beyond its life expectancy and operating on a backup transmitter. Proenza said if it were to fail, forecast tracks could be thrown off by as much as 16 percent. He said Washington reprimanded him for the remarks: ""They wanted me to be quiet about it."" But one of the center's longtime forecasters said Proenza's comments were misguided. ""QuikSCAT is another tool that we use to forecast,"" Lixion Avila said. ""The forecast will not be degraded if we don't have the QuikSCAT."" Last week, the Commerce Department launched an unscheduled review of the hurricane center after word of the staff's dissatisfaction started to become public. His staffers on Thursday issued a petition calling for him to step down. Watch how Proenza lost the confidence of his staff » . The petition said the center's ""effective functioning"" is at stake as the Atlantic hurricane season heads toward its peak. ""The undersigned staff ... has concluded that the center needs a new director, and with the heart of the hurricane season fast approaching, urges the Department of Commerce to make this happen as quickly as possible,"" said the petition, which was signed by twenty-three people, including four of five senior hurricane specialists. Hurricane center staffers told CNN's John Zarella they were unhappy not only about his comments about the QuikSCAT, but also about the environment at the center -- one characterized by closed doors and the public airing of dirty laundry. Proenza on Friday told CNN he had contacted his superiors in Washington about ""ways to move forward,"" but added, ""I am not going to resign."" Proenza told CNN he did not think the staff should dictate the leadership through ""signing petitions."" Proenza graduated from Florida State University with a degree in meteorology. He began his career in tropical meteorology in the mid-1960s at NHC and as a meteorologist on the ""hurricane hunter"" aircraft, according to his biography posted on the agency's Web site. He continued within the National Weather Service for more than 35 years, ""receiving numerous performance commendations and awards, including recognition from the NWS Employees' Organization as the NWS manager of the year for his collaborative leadership,"" the bio said.

"It doesn't sound like you have a realistic view of the economy. The world's wealth is not a zero-sum game. It's the same reason that people can invest in the stock market long term and ALWAYS expect growth (over years, possibly decades). The economy grows. An easy example is the homeless. Even now, at the local shelter I work at, every homeless person has had some fast food within the week and has access to a cellular phone. Either their own or their family's. The poor of today have it incredibly better than the poor of a hundred years ago. Look at all the leisure time we have now in the middle class and lower class. I have a family friend who farmed back in the day. He had maybe 2-3 hours a day, from age 12 to 30, of ""free"" time. Nowadays his kids, in the same farm, have 4+ hours/day, including school. Most American kids have some access to education. Some social welfare program. Something. Compare that with a century ago. 150 years ago in the start of the Industrial Age people had a life expectancy of less than 40 years because of the lack of regulation and laws. Things are improving. The economy is NOT a zero-sum game. Ever heard of the rule of 72? Yeah, your real wealth as a country doubles once every generation or so (at least in developing countries). Where do you get these figures you're saying? What is the majority of the world? How are they in despair? I was perfectly happy being poor when I was younger in a developing country. I'm just as happy, maybe less, once I became (relatively) successful. Also, I don't know what gas tanks you're talking about. I think the highest end sport-yacht is the Cigarette, costing a little under a million. I sincerely doubt they spend as much to top off the gas tank as the yacht costs. Believe it or not, this is not a bad time to be poor at all. Google it if you don't believe me. Lots of sources say that this century is the most peaceful, just to give another comparison. Least violent century in recorded history (not by volume, but by percentage) **TL;DR**: World GDP is not a zero-sum game. This is a great time to be poor and in ""despair.""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- None of the 1,000-plus Iraqi detainees freed in recent weeks have broken a pledge not to return to the insurgency, according to the Marine general who oversees the U.S. detention centers in Iraq. A U.S. military panel reviews a detainee's case at Camp Cropper near Baghdad. Speaking in Arabic, Maj. Gen. Doug Stone on Wednesday reassured Iraqis about how the 25,000 detainees -- mostly Sunnis -- are treated after being taken into custody on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency. Stone described the detention system as ""open and transparent,"" saying it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the country. Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families. The U.S. detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Basra and in Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. The main Sunni political coalition -- the Iraqi Accord Front -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer. Last month, the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation Lion's Paw in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after taking a pledge not to rejoin the insurgency against the Shiite-led government. ""This pledge is an Iraqi pledge, a pledge before an Iraqi judge, frequently with a family member present,"" Stone said. ""I am pleased to tell you that in the more 1,000 that have gone through this program and taken the pledge, not one has returned to threaten Iraqi or coalition forces."" Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan. Stone's description seems a far cry from the Abu Ghraib prison operated by the U.S. military in the first years after the invasion. That prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse. ""There are no secrets that go on in detention,"" Stone said. ""Our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible. These agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world."" See what life's like inside Camp Cropper's walls » . By the time of their release, ""detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment,"" he said. Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said. About one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said. The 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school, Stone said. The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge. Only 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Syria, Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, he said.

"BOLINGBROOK, Illinois (CNN) -- The disappearance of a suburban Chicago police sergeant's wife is now being treated as a potential homicide, and her husband is a suspect, authorities said Friday. Stacy Peterson, 23, has been missing from her suburban Chicago home since October 28. In another development, a judge signed an order to exhume the body of Drew Peterson's third wife, who was found drowned in a bathtub in 2004, said Will County State Attorney James Glasgow. Peterson, 53, said he last spoke to 23-year-old Stacy Peterson -- his fourth wife -- the night of October 28. Drew Peterson initially told the media he believed his wife ran off with another man, but he hasn't repeated that accusation. CNN has been unable to contact Drew Peterson for comment. The couple have been married four years and have two children, who have been interviewed for the investigation, Glasgow said. Drew Peterson also has older children from a previous marriage. Investigators have twice searched the couple's home and vehicles, and removed several items, including computers, said Illinois State Police Capt. Carl Dobrich. Drew Peterson allowed a limited search on the night his wife was reported missing, but investigators were not allowed to look throughout the entire house and were given access to only one of the vehicles at that time, Dobrich said. ""Early on, we looked at this as a missing persons case, but also believed strongly ... it was strongly starting to look at Drew Peterson as being a person of interest,"" Dobrich said. ""I would say that right now, Drew Peterson has gone from being a person of interest to being a suspect."" New information turned up during the investigation also raised questions about the death of Peterson's third wife, Kathleen Savio, which was ruled an accident by a coroner's jury, Glasgow said. ""There are strong indications that it was a homicide,"" he said. ""That's why we are doing the exhumation, because there are tests that need to be done that weren't done during the first autopsy."" Watch why authorities want to exhume the body » . Glasgow cited abrasions on Savio's body and a gash on her head that could not be readily explained. ""Our main thrust is to determine whether or not it was a homicide, and as we do that, we will see if there is any evidence that implicates anyone,"" he said. Glasgow, who was not state attorney at the time of Savio's death, said he reviewed the case file before deciding to reopen the case. ""With 29 years of experience, there was no doubt in my mind it wasn't an accident,"" he said. ""That was clear."" In 2002, Savio was charged once with battery and once with domestic battery against her husband, but was found not guilty at trial, Glasgow said. Another time, she tried to bring domestic battery charges against Peterson, but no charges were ever filed. Savio's sister, Sue Doman, said Savio expressed fear of Drew Peterson. ""She told me all the time, 'He's gonna kill me. It's gonna look like an accident,' "" Doman said. Doman said she didn't believe her sister could have died in the way the investigation concluded. ""I don't understand accidental drowning. You just don't drown in the bathtub, especially a small whirlpool. You just don't do that,"" she said. Meanwhile, friends and family of Stacy Peterson said she expressed concerns about her husband. A friend, Steve Cesare, has told CNN he received e-mail from her describing her relationship as abusive. The woman's aunt, Candace Aikin, of El Monte, California, said Stacy Peterson confided in her that there were problems during a visit to the Peterson home in suburban Chicago last month. ""She said that she was afraid because he was following her around 24/7, even inside the house,"" Aikin said. ""He was very obsessed and stalking her, even inside her house. She was very, very full of stress and just not happy in her marriage at all,"" Aikin said. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"I really get where you're coming from with wanting to date people you know well. Some people will tell you not to wait that long, but I know from personal experience you can't just change your methods like that. That comment tells me you're more about the personality than the looks. Of course you want a cute girl, too, but a girl can become cute to you if she's interesting enough. That's how it is for me, at least. If that doesn't apply to you read someone else's advice, instead, I guess. What I'd recommend in that case is an online dating profile. Online dating is all about personality. You make a profile, answer some compatibility questions, and then see profiles that would be a good fit for you. You get to know girls before you even have to talk to them. And for the most part everyone on these sites is looking for dates so you both know what you're after. (Also, I personally really like OKCupid. There's lots of cool people on there and it's free. This has not been a paid endorsement haha.) As for the virgin thing and the girlfriend dry spell, you can't think about it too much. You can't let it consume you and become desperate. Desperate is not sexy. You have to own who you are. Own it and be awesome about it. You don't have a girlfriend? You don't suck, you've just been waiting until you find a girl that is awesome enough for you. You're overweight?

No matter who you are, what you like, what you look like, there are girls out there that want some of that.

She was stabbed 19 times by two girls who told police it was in ""dedication"" to Slenderman, a fictional character on the website Creepypasta. The family has been raising money for her medical bills and several Wisconsin businesses have come forward to host fundraisers. ""The compassion and love expressed to our family by the people of Wisconsin [and from people around the world] has greatly assisted our family in this healing process,"" the family said in a statement. ""The prayers, cards, hearts, notes, financial support, and now this heartfelt proclamation truly demonstrates that through this tragedy that there is so much goodness in the world.""

Morgan Geyser, 12, and classmate Anissa Weier, 12, have been charged as adults with attempted murder and face up to 60 years in prison. Mr Walker's proclamation includes an invitation to join him in wearing purple in the girl's honour. ""This little girl is overcoming a terrible ordeal,"" he said in a statement. ""Her strength and determination are an inspiration, and on behalf of Wisconsin, I wish her well as she continues her journey to recovery."" According to police, the girls planned to stab the classmate during a sleepover but instead decided to commit the crime the next morning in a nearby park.

"COMMISSION DECISION of 4 April 2007 concerning the publication of the reference of the standard EN 71-1:2005 ‘Safety of Toys - Part 1: mechanical and physical properties’ regarding the technical requirements on projectiles with suction cups as an impact area in accordance with Council Directive 88/378/EEC on the safety of toys (notified under document number C(2007) 1460) (Text with EEA relevance) (2007/224/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Directive 88/378/EEC of 3 May 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning the safety of toys (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof, Having regard to the opinion of the Standing Committee established by Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and on Information Society Services (2), as amended by Directive 98/48/EC (3) (Committee on standards and technical regulations), Whereas: (1) Article 2 of Directive 88/378/EEC provides that toys must be placed on the market only if they do not jeopardise the safety and/or health of users or third parties when they are used as intended or in a foreseeable way, bearing in mind the normal behaviour of children. (2) Pursuant to the Article 5(1) second subparagraph of Directive 88/378/EEC, toys are presumed to comply with the essential safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of the Directive if they conform to the national standards applicable to them transposing the harmonised standards the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. (3) According to the Article 5(1) second subparagraph of Directive 88/378/EEC, Member States are required to publish the reference numbers of national standards transposing harmonised standards, the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. (4) The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), under mandate from the Commission, drew up and adopted the harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 ‘Safety of toys - Part 1: mechanical and physical properties’ on 15 July 1998, the references of which were published for the first time in the Official Journal of the European Communities of 28 July 1999 (4). (5) On 19 September 2005, the European Committee for Standardisation adopted the standard EN 71-1:2005 ‘Safety of toys - Part 1: mechanical and physical properties’ which is a consolidated version of the harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 and its 11 amendments. (6) Pursuant to Article 6(1) of Directive 88/378/EEC, the Spanish authorities have raised a formal objection in respect to the requirements on projectiles toys with suction cups as an impact area intended for children above the age of three years laid down in the standard EN 71-1:2005. The Spanish authorities claim that the standard does not provide enough protection for projectiles toys intended for children above the age of three years. According to the Spanish authorities, a child older than three years might detach a suction cup from a projectile using a force higher than a force of 60 N laid down in clause 8.4.2.3 ‘test for protective components’. (7) The standard EN 71-1:2005 lays down different requirements for toys with suction cups depending on the age of the child. Regarding toys with suction cups intended for children under the age of three years, the standard requires that the ‘tension test’ be performed with a tensile force of 50 N (in case the largest accessible dimension is 6 mm or less) or of 90 N (in case the largest accessible dimension is greater than 6 mm). Regarding projectiles toys with suction cups as an impact area that are intended for children above the age of three years, the standard requires in clause 4.17.1(b) that resilient materials used as impact surfaces shall not become detached when tested according to clause 8.4.2.3 (tension test, protective components). The tension test for protective components specified in clause 8.4.2.3 is performed with a force of 60 N. (8) The Commission has been informed of several accidents with projectiles toys with a suction cup as an impact surface intended for children above the age of three years. In 1997, a Swedish child of nine years old suffocated to death after having sucked on a suction cup tip which he accidentally inhaled. Two other fatalities have occurred in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Commission has been informed of eight fatalities registered in the United States. More recently, in August 2005, the Spanish authorities informed the Commission of a fatal accident with a four years old child caused by a bow and arrow toy with a suction cup. (9) Suction cups affixed to projectile toys are intended for securing the projectile to a surface. Sticking and unsticking the projectiles imply that the suction cup is submitted to repeated stress. Furthermore, children above three years old often bring suction cups to their mouths to moisture the cups before sticking them on a surface. If the suction cup is not properly secured on the toy it is foreseeable that it can be detached during normal and foreseeable use. If the suction cup becomes detached and enters entirely in the mouth, it can block the airway at the back of the mouth and upper throat and cause asphyxiation. (10) On the basis of these findings, the Member States consider that children above the age of three years should be given the same protection as children under the age of three years. Thus, suction cups used as impact surfaces on toy projectiles intended for children over three years shall not become detached when submitted at least to the relevant tests laid down in clause 5.13.b of EN 71-1:2005, in particular to ‘torque test’ (clause 8.3) and ‘tension test, general’ (clause 8.4.2.1). (11) Consequently, on the basis of the information submitted by the Spanish authorities, the other national authorities and the Committee on standards and technical regulations the Commission considers that the standard EN 71-1:2005 presents shortcomings regarding the technical requirements for projectiles toys with suction cups as an impact area intended for children above the age of three years. (12) Pending the revision of the standard, in the interest of safety and legal certainty, the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference of the standard EN 71-1:2005 should therefore be accompanied by an appropriate notice. (13) In absence of a standard that covers the abovementioned risks and according to Article 5(2) of Directive 88/378/EEC, Member States shall presume that the abovementioned toys satisfy the essential safety requirements only if they have an EC type examination certificate issued by a notified body which conformity with the approved model has been certified by the affixation of the EC marking, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 In case of projectile toys with suction cups intended for children above the age of three years, the standard EN 71-1:2005 ‘Safety of toys - Part 1: mechanical and physical properties’ as adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation on 19 September 2005 does not satisfy the essential safety requirements referred to in the Article 3 of the Directive 88/378/EEC, in particular under Annex II.II.1 (e), in so far as concerns clause 4.17.1 (b). Article 2 The publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference of the standard EN 71-1:2005 ‘Safety of toys - Part 1: mechanical and physical properties’ shall be accompanied by the following additional notice: ‘In case of projectiles toys with suction cups with an impact area, the requirement laid down in clause 4.17.1 (b), according to which the tension test is performed in accordance with clause 8.4.2.3, does not cover the risk of asphyxiation presented by these toys’. Article 3 A notice identical to that provided for in Article 2 of this Decision shall accompany the reference to a national standard transposing standard EN 71-1:2005 ‘Safety of toys - Part 1: mechanical and physical properties’, to be published by the Member States pursuant to Article 5(1) second subparagraph of Directive 88/378/EEC. Article 4 This Decision is addressed to the Member States. Done at Brussels, 4 April 2007.",formal
"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Heavy rains and flooding have forced hundreds of thousands of people from homes in southern Mexico's state of Tabasco over the past four days, with nearly as many trapped by the rising waters, state officials said Thursday. Officials say about 300,000 people are still trapped by the worst flooding in the region for 50 years. The Grijalva River pushed over its banks through the state capital of Villahermosa on Thursday, forcing government workers to evacuate and leaving up to 80 percent of the city flooded, Gov. Andres Granier's office told CNN. About 700,000 people have seen their homes flooded, with about 300,000 of those still trapped there, Granier's office reported. One death had been blamed on the floods, which followed weeks of heavy rain in the largely swampy state. Tabasco borders Guatemala to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the north. The Associated Press reported that thousands of people clung to rooftops, huddled inside waterlogged homes or hunkered down in shelters in an attempt to survive the worst flooding the region has seen in 50 years. Weather forecasters predicted more rain in the coming days. The flooding was not related to Tropical Storm Noel, which was pounding the Caribbean. The Grijalva River, one of two large waterways ringing Villahermosa, has risen 6.5 feet (2 meters) above its ""critical"" level and gushed into the city's center, according to AP. Authorities said some of the rivers were continuing to rise. President Felipe Calderon visited the area on Wednesday and promised the federal government's full support. Non-governmental organizations throughout the country asked people to donate non-perishable goods or cash, AP said. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

"He also hailed improving ties between the US and Cuba as ""an example of reconciliation for the whole world"". The Pope was greeted by President Raul Castro after landing in the capital, Havana. The Pope is due to celebrate Mass on Sunday in Havana's iconic Revolution Square. He will spend four days in Cuba before flying to the US. Following his arrival on Cuba on Saturday, thousands lined the route of the Pope's motorcade to the home of the Vatican's ambassador to Cuba. Pope Francis - the first pontiff to hail from Latin America - is credited with helping the recent thaw in diplomatic relations between Cuba and the US. Mr Castro has thanked the Pope for his contribution. Speaking at the airport alongside President Castro, Pope Francis urged further support for Cuba's Catholics ""so that the Church can continue to support and encourage the Cuban people in its hopes and concerns, with the freedom, the means and the space needed to bring the proclamation of the kingdom to the existential peripheries of society"". He also called on Cuba and the US to ""persevere on the path"" of detente. On Thursday the Vatican said it hoped the Pope's visit would help bring an end to the 53-year-old US embargo and lead to more freedom and human rights on the island. Pensioner Diego Carrera told AP the visit was ""like a breath of hope blowing over Cuba"" because of the role that the Pope played in the reestablishment of relations with the US. On Friday the US announced eased restrictions on business and travel with Communist Cuba, the latest move by President Barack Obama to improve relations. At the scene: Will Grant, BBC News, Havana Disembarking to chants of ""Christ lives"" and other religious slogans, the Pope was welcomed off the plane by Raul Castro. He was quick to praise the pontiff for his leadership on issues of climate change and poverty and thanked him for his role in brokering talks with Washington. The Pope said he was in Cuba to ""support and encourage the Cuban people in their hopes and concerns"". While he didn't shy away from using the word ""freedom"" in his initial address, he is still unlikely to publically berate the Cuban government over its human rights record - choosing instead a more pragmatic approach. As the first Latin American pope, he's likely to receive a unique welcome from the Cuban people - many of whom remember when a commitment to atheism was a key part of the constitution. Cuba all set for Pope Francis Cristina Fernandez Kirchner, president of the Pope's native Argentina, also arrived on the island on Saturday and will attend the Mass in Revolution Square. Workers have been building a huge altar and stands for the congregation and choir on the square. Streets have been newly paved in Havana, and the cathedral has been renovated. In the city of Holguin where the Pope will celebrate Mass on Monday, the cathedral has been repaired and repainted. Nearly 1,000 Cuban and foreign journalists were expected to cover the visit. In 1998 Pope John Paul II became the first Pope to visit the island, saying: ""May Cuba... open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba."" His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, also visited Cuba in 2012. Francis's trip will later take him to the US, which he will also be visiting for the first time since his election to the papacy.",formal
"(CNN) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs tried to hang himself earlier this year while he was in jail awaiting trial, according to court documents unsealed by a Utah judge on Tuesday. Sect leader Warren Jeffs arrives in court to hear the verdict against him September 25 in St. George, Utah. Jeffs, the leader and so-called prophet of the 10,000-member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two counts of being an accomplice to rape. The documents, released by Fifth District Judge James Shumate at the request of the media, also indicate that Jeffs confessed to ""immorality"" with a ""sister"" and a daughter more than 30 years ago. Among the documents is a competency report on Jeffs completed in April, in which social worker Eric Nielsen wrote that throughout the month of January, Jeffs refused food and drink and developed ulcers on his knees from kneeling in prayer for hours. On January 28, the report said, he attempted to hang himself in his cell. In the days following the suicide attempt, while he was on suicide watch, Jeffs on separate occasions threw himself against the wall and banged his head on the wall. Jail transcripts show that Jeffs' suicide attempt came three days after a visit with his brother, Nephi, in which he said, ""I am not the prophet. I never was the prophet, and I have been deceived by the powers of evil ... I ask for everyone's forgiveness."" Jeffs also told his brother: ""Farewell forever."" The day before that, Jeffs told a follower in a phone conversation that he was ""covered with immorality with a sister and a daughter when I was younger."" In the FLDS, members call adult women ""sister,"" and Jeffs' meaning was unclear. Jeffs' defense attorneys, who argued against the release of the documents, said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that Jeffs recanted them the following month. Defense attorneys claim Jeffs' medical condition influenced his state of mind when the statements were made. They presented Shumate with a letter from another Jeffs attorney, arguing that the statements' release could influence an Arizona jury when Jeffs stands trial in that state. Jeffs, 51, was convicted in September of being an accomplice to rape. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison when he is sentenced November 20. The FLDS -- which is not affiliated with the mainstream Mormon church -- is based in the side-by-side border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Jeffs, a former school headmaster, is the son of the sect's previous president and ""prophet,"" Rulon Jeffs, who died in 2002. Jeffs was on the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives list when he was arrested in August 2006 outside Las Vegas, Nevada. Critics say that inside the FLDS, marriages are arranged for girls as young as 13, and competition for brides may be reduced by exiling male teens and young men. If male followers are excommunicated, critics claim, wives and children can be reassigned. During Jeffs' trial, defense attorneys claimed authorities were persecuting Jeffs because of his religious beliefs, including practicing polygamy as the way to heaven. If Jeffs disavowed being the prophet of the FLDS, it could cause upheaval within the secretive sect. However, two of his followers who spoke to CNN -- although FLDS members usually do not talk to reporters -- said they do not believe he made the statements. ""He is a perfectly priestly man,"" said a woman who identified herself as Cathy. ""He is a man of God, and we will always love him. Once a prophet, always a prophet."" Her husband, Patrick, told CNN, ""It's hogwash. I don't believe it ... I will always consider him my prophet."" E-mail to a friend . CNN's Gary Tuchman contributed to this report.",formal

"REGULATION (EC) No 1901/2006 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 12 December 2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92, Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1), Having consulted the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty (2), Whereas: (1) Before a medicinal product for human use is placed on the market in one or more Member States, it generally has to have undergone extensive studies, including pre-clinical tests and clinical trials, to ensure that it is safe, of high quality and effective for use in the target population. (2) Such studies may not have been undertaken for use in the paediatric population and many of the medicinal products currently used to treat the paediatric population have not been studied or authorised for such use. Market forces alone have proven insufficient to stimulate adequate research into, and the development and authorisation of, medicinal products for the paediatric population. (3) Problems resulting from the absence of suitably adapted medicinal products for the paediatric population include inadequate dosage information which leads to increased risks of adverse reactions including death, ineffective treatment through under-dosage, non-availability to the paediatric population of therapeutic advances, suitable formulations and routes of administration, as well as use of magistral or officinal formulations to treat the paediatric population which may be of poor quality. (4) This Regulation aims to facilitate the development and accessibility of medicinal products for use in the paediatric population, to ensure that medicinal products used to treat the paediatric population are subject to ethical research of high quality and are appropriately authorised for use in the paediatric population, and to improve the information available on the use of medicinal products in the various paediatric populations. These objectives should be achieved without subjecting the paediatric population to unnecessary clinical trials and without delaying the authorisation of medicinal products for other age populations. (5) While taking into account the fact that the regulation of medicinal products must be fundamentally aimed at safeguarding public health, this aim must be achieved by means that do not impede the free movement of safe medicinal products within the Community. The differences between the national legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions on medicinal products tend to hinder intra-Community trade and therefore directly affect the operation of the internal market. Any action to promote the development and authorisation of medicinal products for paediatric use is therefore justified with a view to preventing or eliminating these obstacles. Article 95 of the Treaty is therefore the proper legal basis. (6) The establishment of a system of both obligations and rewards and incentives has proved necessary to achieve these objectives. The precise nature of these obligations and rewards and incentives should take account of the status of the particular medicinal product concerned. This Regulation should apply to all the medicinal products required for paediatric use and therefore its scope should cover products under development and yet-to-be authorised, authorised products covered by intellectual property rights and authorised products no longer covered by intellectual property rights. (7) Any concerns about conducting trials in the paediatric population should be balanced by the ethical concerns about giving medicinal products to a population in which they have not been appropriately tested. Public health threats from the use of untested medicinal products in the paediatric population can be safely addressed through the study of medicinal products for the paediatric population, which should be carefully controlled and monitored through the specific requirements for the protection of the paediatric population who take part in clinical trials in the Community laid down in Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use (3). (8) It is appropriate to create a scientific committee, the Paediatric Committee, within the European Medicines Agency, hereinafter ‘the Agency’, with expertise and competence in the development and assessment of all aspects of medicinal products to treat paediatric populations. The rules on scientific committees of the Agency, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (4), should apply to the Paediatric Committee. Members of the Paediatric Committee should therefore not have financial or other interests in the pharmaceutical industry which could affect their impartiality, should undertake to act in the public interest and in an independent manner, and should make an annual declaration of their financial interests. The Paediatric Committee should be primarily responsible for the scientific assessment and agreement of paediatric investigation plans and for the system of waivers and deferrals thereof; it should also be central to various support measures contained in this Regulation. In its work, the Paediatric Committee should consider the potential significant therapeutic benefits for the paediatric patients involved in the studies or the paediatric population at large including the need to avoid unnecessary studies. The Paediatric Committee should follow existing Community requirements, including Directive 2001/20/EC, as well as International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E11 on the development of medicinal products for the paediatric population, and it should avoid any delay in the authorisation of medicinal products for other populations deriving from the requirements for studies in the paediatric population. (9) Procedures should be established for the Agency to agree and modify a paediatric investigation plan, which is the document upon which the development and authorisation of medicinal products for the paediatric population should be based. The paediatric investigation plan should include details of the timing and the measures proposed to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in the paediatric population. Since the paediatric population is in fact composed of a number of population subsets, the paediatric investigation plan should specify which population subsets need to be studied, by what means and by when. (10) The introduction of the paediatric investigation plan in the legal framework concerning medicinal products for human use aims at ensuring that the development of medicinal products that are potentially to be used for the paediatric population becomes an integral part of the development of medicinal products, integrated into the development programme for adults. Thus, paediatric investigation plans should be submitted early during product development, in time for studies to be conducted in the paediatric population, where appropriate, before marketing authorisation applications are submitted. It is appropriate to set a deadline for the submission of a paediatric investigation plan in order to ensure early dialogue between the sponsor and the Paediatric Committee. Furthermore, early submission of a paediatric investigation plan, combined with the submission of a deferral request as described below, will avoid delaying the authorisation for other populations. As the development of medicinal products is a dynamic process dependent on the result of ongoing studies, provision should be made for modifying an agreed plan where necessary. (11) It is necessary to introduce a requirement for new medicinal products and for authorised medicinal products covered by a patent or a supplementary protection certificate to present either the results of studies in the paediatric population in accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan or proof of having obtained a waiver or deferral, at the time of filing a marketing authorisation application or an application for a new indication, new pharmaceutical form or new route of administration. The paediatric investigation plan should be the basis upon which compliance with that requirement is judged. However, that requirement should not apply to generics or similar biological medicinal products and medicinal products authorised through the well-established medicinal use procedure, nor to homeopathic medicinal products and traditional herbal medicinal products authorised through the simplified registration procedures of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use (5). (12) Provision should be made for research into the paediatric use of medicinal products which are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate to be financed under Community research programmes. (13) In order to ensure that research in the paediatric population is only conducted to meet their therapeutic needs, there is a need to establish procedures for the Agency to waive the requirement referred to in Recital (11) for specific products or for classes or part of classes of medicinal products, these waivers being then made public by the Agency. As knowledge of science and medicine evolves over time, provision should be made for the lists of waivers to be amended. However, if a waiver is revoked, that requirement should not apply for a given period in order to allow time for at least a paediatric investigation plan to be agreed and studies in the paediatric population to be initiated before an application for marketing authorisation is submitted. (14) In certain cases, the Agency should defer the initiation or completion of some or all of the measures contained in a paediatric investigation plan, with a view to ensuring that research is conducted only when safe and ethical and that the requirement for study data in the paediatric population does not block or delay the authorisation of medicinal products for other populations. (15) Free scientific advice should be provided by the Agency as an incentive to sponsors developing medicinal products for the paediatric population. To ensure scientific consistency, the Agency should manage the interface between the Paediatric Committee and the Scientific Advice Working Group of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, as well as the interaction between the Paediatric Committee and the other Community committees and working groups concerning medicinal products. (16) The existing procedures for the marketing authorisation of medicinal products for human use should not be changed. However, from the requirement referred to in Recital (11) it follows that competent authorities should check compliance with the agreed paediatric investigation plan and any waivers and deferrals at the existing validation step for marketing authorisation applications. The assessment of quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products for the paediatric population and the granting of marketing authorisations should remain the remit of the competent authorities. Provision should be made for the Paediatric Committee to be asked for its opinion on compliance and on the quality, safety and efficacy of a medicinal product in the paediatric population. (17) To provide healthcare professionals and patients with information on the safe and effective use of medicinal products in the paediatric population and as a transparency measure, information on the results of studies in the paediatric population, as well as on the status of the paediatric investigation plans, waivers and deferrals, should be included in product information. When all the measures in the paediatric investigation plan have been complied with, that fact should be recorded in the marketing authorisation, and should then be the basis upon which companies can obtain the rewards for compliance. (18) In order to identify medicinal products authorised for use in the paediatric population and enable their prescription, provision should be made for the labels of medicinal products granted an indication for use in the paediatric population to display a symbol which will be selected by the Commission on a recommendation by the Paediatric Committee. (19) In order to establish incentives for authorised products no longer covered by intellectual property rights, it is necessary to establish a new type of marketing authorisation, the Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation. A Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation should be granted through existing marketing authorisation procedures but should apply specifically for medicinal products developed exclusively for use in the paediatric population. It should be possible for the name of the medicinal product that has been granted a Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation to retain the existing brand name of the corresponding product authorised for adults, in order to capitalise on existing brand recognition, while benefiting from the data exclusivity associated with a new marketing authorisation. (20) An application for a Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation should include the submission of data concerning use of the product in the paediatric population, collected in accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan. These data may be derived from the published literature or from new studies. An application for a Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation should also be able to refer to data contained in the dossier of a medicinal product which is or has been authorised in the Community. This is intended to provide an additional incentive to encourage small and medium-sized enterprises, including generic companies, to develop off-patent medicinal products for the paediatric population. (21) This Regulation should include measures to maximise access by the Community population to new medicinal products tested and adapted for paediatric use, and to minimise the chance of Community-wide rewards and incentives being granted without sections of the Community paediatric population benefiting from the availability of a newly authorised medicine. An application for a marketing authorisation, including an application for a Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation, which contains the results of studies conducted in compliance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan should be eligible for the Community centralised procedure set out in Articles 5 to 15 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. (22) When an agreed paediatric investigation plan has led to the authorisation of a paediatric indication for a product already marketed for other indications, the marketing authorisation holder should be obliged to place the product on the market, taking into account the paediatric information, within two years of the date of approval of the indication. That requirement should relate only to products already authorised, but not to medicinal products authorised via a Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation. (23) An optional procedure should be established to make it possible to obtain a single Community-wide opinion for a nationally authorised medicinal product when data on the paediatric population following an agreed paediatric investigation plan form part of the marketing authorisation application. To achieve this, the procedure set out in Articles 32, 33 and 34 of Directive 2001/83/EC could be used. This will allow the adoption of a Community harmonised Decision on use of that medicinal product in the paediatric population and its inclusion in all national product information. (24) It is essential to ensure that pharmacovigilance mechanisms are adapted to meet the specific challenges of collecting safety data in the paediatric population, including data on possible long-term effects. Efficacy in the paediatric population may also need additional study following authorisation. Therefore, an additional requirement for applying for a marketing authorisation that includes the results of studies conducted in compliance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan should be an obligation for the applicant to indicate how he proposes to ensure the long-term follow-up of possible adverse reactions to the use of the medicinal product and efficacy in the paediatric population. Additionally, where there is a particular cause for concern, the applicant should submit and implement a risk management system and/or perform specific post-marketing studies as a condition for the granting of the marketing authorisation. (25) It is necessary in the interests of public health to ensure the continuing availability of safe and effective medicinal products authorised for paediatric indications developed as a result of this Regulation. If a marketing authorisation holder intends to withdraw such a medicinal product from the market then arrangements should be in place so that the paediatric population can continue to have access to the medicinal product in question. In order to help achieve this, the Agency should be informed in good time of any such intention and should make that intention public. (26) For products falling within the scope of the requirement to submit paediatric data, if all the measures included in the agreed paediatric investigation plan are complied with, if the product is authorised in all Member States and if relevant information on the results of studies is included in product information, a reward should be granted in the form of a 6-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate created by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 (6). Any decisions by Member States' authorities as regards the setting of prices for medicinal products or their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance schemes have no bearing on the granting of this reward. (27) An application for an extension of the duration of the certificate pursuant to this Regulation should only be admissible where a certificate is granted pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92. (28) Because the reward is for conducting studies in the paediatric population and not for demonstrating that a product is safe and effective in the paediatric population, the reward should be granted even when a paediatric indication is not authorised. However, to improve the information available on the use of medicinal products in the paediatric population, relevant information on use in paediatric populations should be included in authorised product information. (29) Under Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products (7), medicinal products designated as orphan medicinal products gain ten years of market exclusivity on the granting of a marketing authorisation for the orphan indication. As such products are frequently not patent-protected, the reward of supplementary protection certificate extension cannot be applied; when they are patent-protected, such an extension would provide a double incentive. Therefore, for orphan medicinal products, instead of an extension of the supplementary protection certificate, the ten-year period of orphan market exclusivity should be extended to twelve years if the requirement for data on use in the paediatric population is fully met. (30) The measures provided for in this Regulation should not preclude the operation of other incentives or rewards. To ensure transparency on the different measures available at Community and Member State levels, the Commission should draw up a detailed list of all the incentives available, on the basis of information provided by the Member States. The measures set out in this Regulation, including the agreement of paediatric investigation plans, should not be grounds for obtaining any other Community incentives to support research, such as the funding of research projects under the multi-annual Community Framework Programmes for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities. (31) In order to increase the availability of information on the use of medicinal products in the paediatric population, and to avoid unnecessary repetition of studies in the paediatric population which do not add to the collective knowledge, the European database provided for in Article 11 of Directive 2001/20/EC should include a European register of clinical trials of medicinal products for paediatric use comprising all ongoing, prematurely terminated, and completed paediatric studies conducted both in the Community and in third countries. Part of the information concerning paediatric clinical trials entered into the database, as well as details of the results of all paediatric clinical trials submitted to the competent authorities, should be made public by the Agency. (32) An inventory of the therapeutic needs of the paediatric population should be established by the Paediatric Committee after consultation with the Commission, the Member States and interested parties, and should be regularly updated. The inventory should identify the existing medicinal products used by the paediatric population and highlight the therapeutic needs of that population and the priorities for research and development. In this way, companies should be able easily to identify opportunities for business development; the Paediatric Committee should be able better to judge the need for medicinal products and studies when assessing draft paediatric investigation plans, waivers and deferrals; and healthcare professionals and patients should have an information source available to support their decisions as to which medicinal products to choose. (33) Clinical trials in the paediatric population may require specific expertise, specific methodology and, in some cases, specific facilities and should be carried out by appropriately trained investigators. A network, which links existing national and Community initiatives and study centres in order to build up the necessary competences at Community level, and which takes account of Community and third country data, would help facilitate cooperation and avoid unnecessary duplication of studies. This network should contribute to the work of strengthening the foundations of the European Research Area in the context of Community Framework Programmes for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities, benefit the paediatric population and provide a source of information and expertise for industry. (34) For certain authorised products, pharmaceutical companies may already hold data on safety or efficacy in the paediatric population. To improve the information available on the use of medicinal products in the paediatric populations, companies holding such data should be required to submit them to all competent authorities where the product is authorised. In this way the data could be assessed and, if appropriate, information should be included in the authorised product information aimed at healthcare professionals and patients. (35) Community funding should be provided to cover all aspects of the work of the Paediatric Committee and of the Agency resulting from the implementation of this Regulation, such as the assessment of paediatric investigation plans, fee waivers for scientific advice, and information and transparency measures, including the database of paediatric studies and the network. (36) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (8). (37) Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92, Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly. (38) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely improving availability of medicinal products tested for paediatric use, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, given that this will make it possible to take advantage of the widest possible market and avoid the dispersion of limited resources, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: TITLE I INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS CHAPTER 1 Subject matter and definitions Article 1 This Regulation lays down rules concerning the development of medicinal products for human use in order to meet the specific therapeutic needs of the paediatric population, without subjecting the paediatric population to unnecessary clinical or other trials and in compliance with Directive 2001/20/EC. Article 2 In addition to the definitions laid down in Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC, the following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this Regulation: 1) ‘paediatric population’ means that part of the population aged between birth and 18 years; 2) ‘paediatric investigation plan’ means a research and development programme aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are generated determining the conditions in which a medicinal product may be authorised to treat the paediatric population; 3) ‘medicinal product authorised for a paediatric indication’ means a medicinal product which is authorised for use in part or all of the paediatric population and in respect of which the details of the authorised indication are specified in the summary of the product characteristics drawn up in accordance with Article 11 of Directive 2001/83/EC; 4) ‘paediatric use marketing authorisation’ means a marketing authorisation granted in respect of a medicinal product for human use which is not protected by a supplementary protection certificate under Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 or by a patent which qualifies for the granting of the supplementary protection certificate, covering exclusively therapeutic indications which are relevant for use in the paediatric population, or subsets thereof, including the appropriate strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for that product. CHAPTER 2 Paediatric committee Article 3 1. By 26 July 2007, a Paediatric Committee shall be established within the European Medicines Agency set up under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, hereinafter ‘the Agency’.

The Paediatric Committee shall take into account any information available to it, including any opinions, decisions or advice given by the competent authorities of third countries. TITLE II MARKETING AUTHORISATION REQUIREMENTS CHAPTER 1 General authorisation requirements Article 7 1. An application for marketing authorisation under Article 6 of Directive 2001/83/EC in respect of a medicinal product for human use which is not authorised in the Community at the time of entry into force of this Regulation shall be regarded as valid only if it includes, in addition to the particulars and documents referred to in Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, one of the following: (a) the results of all studies performed and details of all information collected in compliance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan; (b) a decision of the Agency granting a product-specific waiver; (c) a decision of the Agency granting a class waiver pursuant to Article 11; (d) a decision of the Agency granting a deferral. For the purposes of point (a), the decision of the Agency agreeing the paediatric investigation plan concerned shall also be included in the application. 2. The documents submitted pursuant to paragraph 1 shall, cumulatively, cover all subsets of the paediatric population. Article 8 In the case of authorised medicinal products which are protected either by a supplementary protection certificate under Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92, or by a patent which qualifies for the granting of the supplementary protection certificate, Article 7 of this Regulation shall apply to applications for authorisation of new indications, including paediatric indications, new pharmaceutical forms and new routes of administration. For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the documents referred to in Article 7(1) shall cover both the existing and the new indications, pharmaceutical forms and routes of administration. Article 9 Articles 7 and 8 shall not apply to products authorised under Articles 10, 10a, 13 to 16 or 16a to 16i of Directive 2001/83/EC. Article 10 In consultation with the Member States, the Agency and other interested parties, the Commission shall draw up the detailed arrangements concerning the format and content which applications for agreement or modification of a paediatric investigation plan and requests for waivers or deferrals must follow in order to be considered valid and concerning the operation of the compliance check referred to in Articles 23 and 28(3). CHAPTER 2 Waivers Article 11 1. Production of the information referred to in point (a) of Article 7(1) shall be waived for specific medicinal products or for classes of medicinal products, if there is evidence showing any of the following: (a) that the specific medicinal product or class of medicinal products is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in part or all of the paediatric population; (b) that the disease or condition for which the specific medicinal product or class is intended occurs only in adult populations; (c) that the specific medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric patients. 2. The waiver provided for in paragraph 1 may be issued with reference either to one or more specified subsets of the paediatric population, or to one or more specified therapeutic indications, or to a combination of both. Article 12 The Paediatric Committee may of its own motion adopt an opinion, on the grounds set out in Article 11(1), to the effect that a class or a product-specific waiver, as referred to in Article 11(1), should be granted. As soon as the Paediatric Committee adopts an opinion, the procedure laid down in Article 25 shall apply. In the case of a class waiver, only paragraphs 6 and 7 of Article 25 shall apply. Article 13 1. The applicant may, on the grounds set out in Article 11(1), apply to the Agency for a product-specific waiver. 2. Following receipt of the application, the Paediatric Committee shall appoint a rapporteur and shall within 60 days adopt an opinion as to whether or not a product-specific waiver should be granted. Either the applicant or the Paediatric Committee may request a meeting during that 60-day period. Whenever appropriate, the Paediatric Committee may request the applicant to supplement the particulars and documents submitted. Where the Paediatric Committee avails itself of this option, the 60-day time-limit shall be suspended until such time as the supplementary information requested has been provided. 3. As soon as the Paediatric Committee adopts an opinion, the procedure laid down in Article 25 shall apply. Article 14 1. The Agency shall maintain a list of all waivers. The list shall be regularly updated (at least every year) and made available to the public. 2. The Paediatric Committee may, at any time, adopt an opinion advocating the review of a granted waiver. In the case of a change affecting a product-specific waiver, the procedure laid down in Article 25 shall apply. In the case of a change affecting a class waiver, paragraphs 6 and 7 of Article 25 shall apply. 3. If a particular product-specific or class waiver is revoked, the requirement set out in Articles 7 and 8 shall not apply for 36 months from the date of the removal from the list of waivers. CHAPTER 3 Paediatric investigation plan Section 1 Requests for agreement Article 15 1. Where the intention is to apply for a marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 7(1)(a) or (d), Article 8 or Article 30, a paediatric investigation plan shall be drawn up and submitted to the Agency with a request for agreement. 2. The paediatric investigation plan shall specify the timing and the measures proposed to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in all subsets of the paediatric population that may be concerned. In addition, it shall describe any measures to adapt the formulation of the medicinal product so as to make its use more acceptable, easier, safer or more effective for different subsets of the paediatric population. Article 16 1. In the case of the applications for marketing authorisation referred to in Articles 7 and 8 or the applications for waiver referred to in Articles 11 and 12, the paediatric investigation plan or the application for waiver shall be submitted with a request for agreement, except in duly justified cases, not later than upon completion of the human pharmaco-kinetic studies in adults specified in Section 5.2.3 of Part I of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC, so as to ensure that an opinion on use in the paediatric population of the medicinal product concerned can be given at the time of the assessment of the marketing authorisation or other application concerned. 2. Within 30 days following receipt of the request referred to in paragraph 1 and in Article 15(1), the Agency shall verify the validity of the request and prepare a summary report for the Paediatric Committee. 3. Whenever appropriate, the Agency may ask the applicant to submit additional particulars and documents, in which case the time-limit of 30 days shall be suspended until such time as the supplementary information requested has been provided. Article 17 1. Following receipt of a proposed paediatric investigation plan which is valid in accordance with the provisions of Article 15(2), the Paediatric Committee shall appoint a rapporteur and shall within 60 days adopt an opinion as to whether or not the proposed studies will ensure the generation of the necessary data determining the conditions in which the medicinal product may be used to treat the paediatric population or subsets thereof, and as to whether or not the expected therapeutic benefits justify the studies proposed. When adopting its opinion, the Committee shall consider whether or not the measures proposed to adapt the formulation of the medicinal product for use in different subsets of the paediatric population are appropriate. Within the same period, either the applicant or the Paediatric Committee may request a meeting. 2. Within the 60-day period referred to in paragraph 1, the Paediatric Committee may request the applicant to propose modifications to the plan, in which case the time-limit referred to in paragraph 1 for the adoption of the final opinion shall be extended for a maximum of 60 days. In such cases, the applicant or the Paediatric Committee may request an additional meeting during this period. The time-limit shall be suspended until such time as the supplementary information requested has been provided. Article 18 As soon as the Paediatric Committee adopts an opinion, whether positive or negative, the procedure laid down in Article 25 shall apply. Article 19 If, having considered a paediatric investigation plan, the Paediatric Committee concludes that Article 11(1)(a), (b) or (c) applies to the medicinal product concerned, it shall adopt a negative opinion under Article 17(1). In such cases, the Paediatric Committee shall adopt an opinion in favour of a waiver under Article 12, whereupon the procedure laid down in Article 25 shall apply. Section 2 Deferrals Article 20 1. At the same time as the paediatric investigation plan is submitted under Article 16(1), a request may be made for deferral of the initiation or completion of some or all of the measures set out in that plan. Such deferral shall be justified on scientific and technical grounds or on grounds related to public health. In any event, a deferral shall be granted when it is appropriate to conduct studies in adults prior to initiating studies in the paediatric population or when studies in the paediatric population will take longer to conduct than studies in adults. 2. On the basis of the experience acquired as a result of the operation of this Article, the Commission may adopt provisions in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 51(2) to define further the grounds for granting a deferral. Article 21 1. At the same time as the Paediatric Committee adopts a positive opinion under Article 17(1), it shall, of its own motion or following a request submitted by the applicant under Article 20, adopt an opinion, if the conditions specified in Article 20 are met, in favour of deferring the initiation or completion of some or all of the measures in the paediatric investigation plan. An opinion in favour of a deferral shall specify the time-limits for initiating or completing the measures concerned. 2. As soon as the Paediatric Committee adopts an opinion in favour of deferral, as referred to in paragraph 1, the procedure laid down in Article 25 shall apply. Section 3 Modification of a paediatric investigation plan Article 22 If, following the decision agreeing the paediatric investigation plan, the applicant encounters such difficulties with its implementation as to render the plan unworkable or no longer appropriate, the applicant may propose changes or request a deferral or a waiver, based on detailed grounds, to the Paediatric Committee. Within 60 days, the Paediatric Committee shall review these changes or the request for a deferral or a waiver and adopt an opinion proposing their refusal or acceptance. As soon as the Paediatric Committee adopts an opinion, whether positive or negative, the procedure laid down in Article 25 shall apply. Section 4 Compliance with the paediatric investigation plan Article 23 1. The competent authority responsible for granting marketing authorisation shall verify whether an application for marketing authorisation or variation complies with the requirements laid down in Articles 7 and 8 and whether an application submitted pursuant to Article 30 complies with the agreed paediatric investigation plan. Where the application is submitted in accordance with the procedure set out in Articles 27 to 39 of Directive 2001/83/EC, the verification of compliance, including, as appropriate, requesting an opinion of the Paediatric Committee in accordance with paragraph 2(b) and (c) of this Article, shall be conducted by the reference Member State. 2. The Paediatric Committee may, in the following cases, be requested to give its opinion as to whether studies conducted by the applicant are in compliance with the agreed paediatric investigation plan: (a) by the applicant, prior to submitting an application for marketing authorisation or variation as referred to in Articles 7, 8 and 30, respectively; (b) by the Agency, or the national competent authority, when validating an application, as referred to in point (a), which does not include an opinion concerning compliance adopted following a request under point (a); (c) by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the national competent authority, when assessing an application, as referred to in point (a), where there is doubt concerning compliance and an opinion has not been already given following a request under points (a) or (b). In the case of point (a), the applicant shall not submit its application until the Paediatric Committee has adopted its opinion, and a copy thereof shall be annexed to the application. 3. If the Paediatric Committee is requested to give an opinion under paragraph 2, it shall do so within 60 days of receiving the request. Member States shall take account of such an opinion. Article 24 If, when conducting the scientific assessment of a valid application for Marketing Authorisation, the competent authority concludes that the studies are not in conformity with the agreed paediatric investigation plan, the product shall not be eligible for the rewards and incentives provided for in Articles 36, 37 and 38. CHAPTER 4 Procedure Article 25 1. Within ten days of its receipt, the Agency shall transmit the opinion of the Paediatric Committee to the applicant. 2. Within 30 days following receipt of the opinion of the Paediatric Committee, the applicant may submit to the Agency a written request, citing detailed grounds, for a re-examination of the opinion. 3. Within 30 days following receipt of a request for re-examination pursuant to paragraph 2, the Paediatric Committee, having appointed a new rapporteur, shall issue a new opinion confirming or revising its previous opinion. The rapporteur shall be able to question the applicant directly. The applicant may also offer to be questioned. The rapporteur shall inform the Paediatric Committee without delay in writing about details of contacts with the applicant. The opinion shall be duly reasoned and a statement of reasons for the conclusion reached shall be annexed to the new opinion, which shall become definitive. 4. If, within the 30-day period referred to in paragraph 2, the applicant does not request re-examination, the opinion of the Paediatric Committee shall become definitive. 5. The Agency shall adopt a decision within a period not exceeding 10 days following receipt of the Paediatric Committee's definitive opinion. This decision shall be communicated to the applicant in writing and shall annex the definitive opinion of the Paediatric Committee. 6. In the case of a class waiver as referred to in Article 12, the Agency shall adopt a decision within ten days following receipt of the opinion of the Paediatric Committee as referred to in Article 13(3). This decision shall annex the opinion of the Paediatric Committee. 7. Decisions of the Agency shall be made public after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. CHAPTER 5 Miscellaneous provisions Article 26 Any legal or natural person developing a medicinal product intended for paediatric use may, prior to the submission of a paediatric investigation plan and during its implementation, request advice from the Agency on the design and conduct of the various tests and studies necessary to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in the paediatric population in accordance with Article 57(1)(n) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. In addition, this legal or natural person may request advice on the design and conduct of pharmacovigilance and risk management systems as referred to in Article 34. The Agency shall provide advice under this Article free of charge. TITLE III MARKETING AUTHORISATION PROCEDURES Article 27 Save where otherwise provided in this Title, marketing authorisation procedures for the marketing authorisations covered by this Title shall be governed by the provisions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or in Directive 2001/83/EC. CHAPTER 1 Marketing authorisation procedures for applications falling within the scope of Articles 7 and 8 Article 28 1. Applications may be submitted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 5 to 15 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for a marketing authorisation as referred to in Article 7(1) of this Regulation which includes one or more paediatric indications on the basis of studies conducted in compliance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan. Where authorisation is granted, the results of all those studies shall be included in the summary of product characteristics and, if appropriate, in the package leaflet of the medicinal product, provided that the competent authority deems the information to be of use to patients, whether or not all the paediatric indications concerned were approved by the competent authority. 2. Where a marketing authorisation is granted or varied, any waiver or deferral which has been granted pursuant to this Regulation shall be recorded in the summary of product characteristics and, if appropriate, in the package leaflet of the medicinal product concerned. 3. If the application complies with all the measures contained in the agreed completed paediatric investigation plan and if the summary of product characteristics reflects the results of studies conducted in compliance with that agreed paediatric investigation plan, the competent authority shall include within the marketing authorisation a statement indicating compliance of the application with the agreed completed paediatric investigation plan. For the purpose of the application of Article 45(3), this statement shall also indicate whether significant studies contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan have been completed after the entry into force of this Regulation. Article 29 In the case of medicinal products authorised under Directive 2001/83/EC, an application as referred to in Article 8 of this Regulation may be submitted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 32, 33 and 34 of Directive 2001/83/EC, for authorisation of a new indication, including the extension of an authorisation for use in the paediatric population, a new pharmaceutical form or a new route of administration. That application shall comply with the requirement laid down in point (a) of Article 7(1). The procedure shall be limited to the assessment of the specific sections of the summary of product characteristics to be varied. CHAPTER 2 Paediatric use marketing authorisation Article 30 1. Submission of an application for a paediatric use marketing authorisation shall in no way preclude the right to apply for a marketing authorisation for other indications. 2. An application for a paediatric use marketing authorisation shall be accompanied by the particulars and documents necessary to establish quality, safety and efficacy in the paediatric population, including any specific data needed to support an appropriate strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for the product, in accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan. The application shall also include the decision of the Agency agreeing the paediatric investigation plan concerned. 3. Where a medicinal product is or has been authorised in a Member State or in the Community, data contained in the dossier on that product may, where appropriate, be referred to, in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC, in an application for a paediatric use marketing authorisation. 4. The medicinal product in respect of which a paediatric use marketing authorisation is granted may retain the name of any medicinal product which contains the same active substance and in respect of which the same holder has been granted authorisation for use in adults. Article 31 Without prejudice to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, an application for a paediatric use marketing authorisation may be made in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 5 to 15 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. CHAPTER 3 Identification Article 32 1. Where a medicinal product is granted a marketing authorisation for a paediatric indication, the label shall display the symbol agreed in accordance with paragraph 2. The package leaflet shall contain an explanation of the meaning of the symbol. 2. By 26 January 2008, the Commission shall select a symbol following a recommendation of the Paediatric Committee. The Commission shall make the symbol public. 3. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to medicinal products authorised before the entry into force of this Regulation, and to medicinal products authorised after the entry into force of this Regulation but before the symbol has been made public, if they are authorised for paediatric indications. In this case, the symbol and the explanation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be included in the labelling and package leaflet respectively of the medicinal products concerned not later than two years after the symbol has been made public. TITLE IV POST-AUTHORISATION REQUIREMENTS Article 33 Where medicinal products are authorised for a paediatric indication following completion of an agreed paediatric investigation plan and those products have already been marketed with other indications, the marketing authorisation holder shall, within two years of the date on which the paediatric indication is authorised, place the product on the market taking into account the paediatric indication. A register, coordinated by the Agency, and made publicly available, shall mention these deadlines. Article 34 1. In the following cases, the applicant shall detail the measures to ensure the follow-up of efficacy and of possible adverse reactions to the paediatric use of the medicinal product: (a) applications for a marketing authorisation that includes a paediatric indication; (b) applications to include a paediatric indication in an existing marketing authorisation; (c) applications for a paediatric use marketing authorisation. 2. Where there is particular cause for concern, the competent authority shall require, as a condition for granting marketing authorisation, that a risk management system be set up or that specific post-marketing studies be performed and submitted for review. The risk management system shall comprise a set of pharmacovigilance activities and interventions designed to identify, characterise, prevent or minimise risks relating to medicinal products, including the assessment of the effectiveness of those interventions. Assessment of the effectiveness of any risk management system and the results of any studies performed shall be included in the periodic safety update reports referred to in Article 104(6) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 24(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. In addition, the competent authority may request submission of additional reports assessing the effectiveness of any risk minimisation system and the results of any such studies performed. 3. In addition to paragraphs 1 and 2, the provisions on pharmacovigilance as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and in Directive 2001/83/EC shall apply to marketing authorisations for medicinal products which include a paediatric indication. 4. In the case of a deferral, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit an annual report to the Agency providing an update on progress with paediatric studies in accordance with the decision of the Agency agreeing the paediatric investigation plan and granting a deferral. The Agency shall inform the competent authority if it is found that the marketing authorisation holder has failed to comply with the decision of the Agency agreeing the paediatric investigation plan and granting a deferral. 5. The Agency shall draw up guidelines relating to the application of this Article. Article 35 If a medicinal product is authorised for a paediatric indication and the marketing authorisation holder has benefited from rewards or incentives under Article 36, 37 or 38, and these periods of protection have expired, and if the marketing authorisation holder intends to discontinue placing the medicinal product on the market, the marketing authorisation holder shall transfer the marketing authorisation or allow a third party, which has declared its intention to continue to place the medicinal product in question on the market, to use the pharmaceutical, pre-clinical and clinical documentation contained in the file of the medicinal product on the basis of Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC. The marketing authorisation holder shall inform the Agency of its intention to discontinue the placing on the market of the product no less than six months before the discontinuation. The Agency shall make this fact public. TITLE V REWARDS AND INCENTIVES Article 36 1. Where an application under Article 7 or 8 includes the results of all studies conducted in compliance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan, the holder of the patent or supplementary protection certificate shall be entitled to a six-month extension of the period referred to in Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92.

"Big oil producing nations meet this weekend in Qatar to discuss plans for a freeze in production levels. But there is scepticism over whether such a deal would make much difference to the current oversupply of oil in the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 28.97 points to 17,897.46. The S&P 500 was down 2.05 points to 2,080.73. The technology focused Nasdaq Composite slipped 7.67 points to 4,938.22. Stocks in the energy sectors fell as another US bank - Citigroup - reported it was setting cash aside to cover losses on loans to the energy industry. Shares in banking giant Citigroup closed 0.13% down after trading mostly higher all day. It reported a 27% fall in quarterly profit, but that was not as bad as analysts had been expecting. Shares of Marathon Petroleum were down 3.8%, Exxon Mobile fell 0.5% and Chevron was 0.75% lower. Shares of Apple dropped 2% after a report suggested the company was cutting iPhone production in the April-June quarter due to weak sales. Investors also had a gloomy economic report to chew over. US industrial production fell 0.6% in March, which was a bigger drop than analysts were expecting, and followed a 0.6% decline in February.",formal

"North and his fellow Wales wing Alex Cuthbert scored the Lions's tries in the 23-21 win in Brisbane. Australia would have won had replacement Kurtley Beale not failed with two late penalties. ""It was a remarkable win and a remarkable result,"" North said. ""It was an unbelievable feeling. We won and I got my first [Lions] Test try. It doesn't get much better than that. ""My heart was in my mouth at the end. I think everyone was feeling the same. ""It's always good to get a win, and while it was tough towards the end we are delighted to have got that first win in the series. ""We've spoken a lot about momentum these past few weeks, and that could be huge for us now heading into the second Test next week."" The Wallabies were leading 7-3 through Israel Folau's converted before the Lions hit back with a fine individual try from North. The 21-year-old, making his Lions Test debut, effortlessly beat three players during a 60-metre run before crossing for his third try of the tour. ""When the ball dropped out of the sky, my first thought was just to run,"" said North. ""Luckily, I saw a gap and I just went for it. It opened up for me, and I can't begin to tell you how good it felt when I crossed that line."" North, who has joined Northampton Saints from Scarlets ahead of the 2013-14 season, thought he had struck again just five minutes later when he squeezed over in the corner. But the television match official ruled a combination of opposite number Israel Folau getting a hand underneath the ball and the Lions wing's free arm hitting the touchline meant no try. ""I felt it was a try. At the end of the day, the TMO makes his call and you have to live with it. But I certainly felt that I had got there,"" North added. ""Perhaps one or two things didn't quite go for us in that regard today, so it makes the win even better."" The Lions face Melbourne Rebels, led by former Wales number eight Gareth Delve, on Tuesday before next Saturday's second Test against the Wallabies in the same city. Victory at Melbourne's Etihad Stadium would secure a first Lions Test series win since 1997 but North believes there is room for improvement. ""I definitely think we can play a lot better than we did,"" North added. ""We need to be more clinical, and we need to get a bit more accuracy in our game. ""It's a funny one, really. We know we can play better than that, but we are obviously still delighted to get the win. ""That wasn't our best performance, and we need to keep pushing for next week."" North's Wales team-mate Cuthbert, who scored the Lions' second try, expects an Australian backlash in the second Test. ""Australia are not going to lie down and let us win this,"" Cuthbert said. ""They're going to put in one hell of an effort and I think they thought they probably could have won that game so they're going to be straight at us again next week. We've got a lot to work on.""",formal

"Gundogan, 26, told BBC Sport he ""can see the finishing line"" after tearing cruciate knee ligaments in December, but will not rush his return. The German missed the 2014 World Cup following back surgery that kept him out for a year, and sat out Euro 2016 because of a dislocated kneecap. He said: ""It is heavy mentally to accept that."" Gundogan will not be fit for the start of the Premier League season at Brighton on 12 August but said his recovery time is now being measured in ""weeks"" rather than months. He told BBC Sport: ""It is really hard always to fall and fight your way back. You feel good and feel ready, then you get the next kick. ""The worst part is behind me now. I want to feel ready when I am fully back. I want to feel safe and confident. I don't mind if it is two weeks or six."" Gundogan made 15 appearances and scored five goals in his debut season for City following his £20m move from Borussia Dortmund. He is eager to get on the field again and was impressed at the club's 4-1 win over Real Madrid in a pre-season game in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Manager Pep Guardiola has made five new signings already this summer and continues to have an interest in Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe. Gundogan said: ""Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely. ""We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start."" City complete their three-match tour of the United States against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United. Spurs have had the advantage in their recent meetings with City, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games. And Gundogan thinks they are a major threat. He said: ""Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them. ""They are really uncomfortable to play against. ""I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.""",formal
"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Juan Roman Riquelme scored twice as Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 to notch a third successive victory in the South American qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup on Saturday. Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand. And he finished off the scoring in the 73rd minute with a cool sidefoot finish after being set up by Messi to cap off a match in which captain Javier Zanetti made a record-breaking 116th appearance for Argentina. Argentina next travel to Colombia on Tuesday, when winless Bolivia have an away clash with Venezuela. In other South American qualifiers, Colombia beat Venezuela 1-0, and Paraguay routed Ecuador 5-1.

"No, you're not alone. I didn't take one either. I *did* sit in on the BRC when my wife took it. The instructor you get when you take the MSF is pivotal in how beneficial your BRC experience will be. My wife's instructors were just a couple of good-ol'-boys earning a little extra cash on weekends. I believe many new riders put too much stock in what an MSF course instructor has to say, as though they are the end-all-be-all in motorcycling technique. The curriculum is essentially the same defensive driving techniques taught in high school drivers' ed. It's not some magic bean that keeps you from dying on the street. It's not a magic common sense pill either. Her class was geared toward cruiser riders as well. The myths about front brake vs. rear brake were actually taught in her class. Then, as the husband, it's difficult to refute the misinformation she was given by this motorcycling god placed before her by fate. Edit: I'd like to add that about 6 miles into her 2nd ride, she went wide in a right-hander, froze at the controls and crashed in the grass. I was behind her and had to watch and hear (Chatterboxes) the whole thing. She was uninjured but her Baby Ninja wasn't rideable. This was a week after she passed her BRC at what her instructors said was the ""top of the class."" TL;DR: The MSF, while a good base, isn't going to transform anyone into a good rider. Common sense, respect for the machine, a thirst for knowledge (and research), the ability to think critically and apply that to the controls and a host of traits that some people just don't have will go a lot farther to surviving your motorcycle.",informal

"MADRID, Spain -- David Nalbandian battled back to stun world No. 1 Roger Federer with a 1-6 6-3 6-3 victory in the final of the Madrid Masters on Sunday. David Nalbandian celebrates after upsetting Roger Federer in the Madrid Masters final. The Argentine, ranked 25th in the world, repeated his 2005 upset win over the Swiss star in that year's season-ending Masters Cup -- also an indoor event. Defending champion Federer, playing in his first tournament since winning the U.S. Open six weeks ago, made 38 unforced errors. Nalbandian became only the third player -- and the second this year after Novak Djokovic in Montreal in August -- to beat the world's top-three players en route to winning a title. German legend Boris Becker was the first to perform the feat 13 years ago. Nalbandian ousted second-ranked Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals and then Serbian Djokovic in Saturday's semis. The 25-year-old, who lost in the Madrid final in 2004, claimed his first triumph on the ATP Tour since May, 2006, on clay in Portugal. He spent a year without a coach, but has revived his career since teaming up with Hernan Gumy. ""I'm extremely contented to beat the world number one,"" Nalbandian said. ""Roger and I have a long history and I think that influenced the match. ""It was an extremely hard first set. But I tightened the teeth and I began to play more strongly. Things came out fine, I played incredible, and that of course that helps."" Federer added: ""He served well, I was quite surprised with how well he served. ""He came back strong and played well in the end. ""He was a better player all in all. I was struggling after the first set to play aggressively, for some reason. He played tough and didn't miss any more. I couldn't play way I wanted to. It was a pity, he played a great tournament."" E-mail to a friend .",formal

"LONDON, England -- France coach Raymond Domenech has again omitted striker David Trezeguet from his squad for this month's friendly against Morocco and the Euro 2008 qualifier against the Ukraine. Happier times: David Trezeguet celebrates after scoring for Juventus against Torino. Trezeguet has scored scored 10 goals in 11 Serie A matches for Juventus this season -- including two hat-tricks -- but has failed to win his way back into the 24-man party. The 29-year-old, who last played for France in the 1-0 home defeat by Scotland in September, was furious after being dropped for the games against Lithuania and the Faroe Islands. He played no part as Domenech's team overtook the Scots at the top of Group B with comfortable victories last month. The coach said: ""David is having a great start to the season with Juventus, but he's in competition for a place. If we qualify, the Euro 2008 will be in eight months. A lot of things can happen in between. ""I hope David will help Juventus win the Italian league title and that he will be at the Euro 2008 with us, and that he will find his form again for France."" Domenech has again included young Lyon forward Hatem Ben Arfa, who made his debut as a substitute against the Faroes and scored the final goal in a 6-0 victory. Ben Arfa is joined in the squad by club-mate Karim Benzema, while Bolton's Nicholas Anelka is also among the forwards named despite still recovering from an injury. Captain Patrick Vieira is ruled out due to injury, but the Inter Milan midfielder will join up with the squad anyway. ""A player of Patrick's dimension is going to be missed, but we just have to accept it and get on with it. Pat should be coming to see us because he's a leader, and he's the captain,"" Domenech added. France face the Moroccans on November 16 and then travel to the Ukraine on November 21. Domenech's team will qualify for the finals if Italy beat Scotland at Hampden on November 17. If the Glasgow game ends in a draw, France will need at least a point in Kiev to book their ticket.

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Former football star O.J. Simpson walked out of jail late Wednesday after posting $250,000 bail. O.J. Simpson leaves the Clark County Detention Center late Wednesday night. Eighth District Judge Jackie Glass hours earlier doubled Simpson's bail to ensure his appearance at an April 7 trial. Glass said Simpson had violated terms of his previous bail. Glass was adamant that Simpson remain in the Clark County Detention Center until 15 percent of the $250,000 is paid in full -- $37,500 -- after it was revealed in court that Simpson never paid any part of his previous $125,000 bail. ""There's no 'get-out-of-jail-free card' today,"" an angry Glass told Simpson's lawyers. ""I don't want him out of the jail until the 15 percent is paid in full."" Watch the scolding judge » . The judge scolded Simpson, saying he wasn't taking the matter seriously. ""I don't know if it's just arrogance. I don't know if it's ignorance,"" she chided. Simpson posted bail at about 6:15 p.m. local time (9:15 p.m. ET), according to Las Vegas authorities. Simpson returned to jail in Nevada from his home in Florida January 11 for Wednesday's hearing, after prosecutors alleged he violated the terms of his bail by attempting to contact a co-defendant. The original bail bondsman -- Miguel Pereira of Florida-based You Ring, We Spring -- testified Wednesday that the former football player didn't put any money toward the bail that allowed him to leave jail in September. ""Not one cent,"" he said. The bail bondsman himself paid the 15 percent premium and the $40 filing fee to allow Simpson to leave the detention center, although he said he had a power of attorney for Simpson's Florida home but never filed a lien on it. When questioned by Simpson attorney Yale Galanter, Pereira admitted he had never sent Simpson a bill for the premium. But, he said, he had an understanding with Simpson that he would be paid ""after it was all over."" Glass described it as ""mind-boggling"" that Simpson never had to put up any collateral for his first bond and that the bail bondsman never asked for anything. Prosecutors also produced Wednesday a recording of a profanity-laced voice mail message left on Pereira's answering machine in November from Simpson, which he told Pereira to deliver to co-defendant Clarence Stewart. The prosecutor said the message contained ""an undercurrent of a threat,"" and he wanted the bail to be raised to at least $1 million. Galanter did not contest the authenticity of the recording. As part of his bail granted September 19, Simpson was to have no contact whatsoever with victims, witnesses or co-defendants in the case. Glass said the same goes this time. Watch how Simpson wound up in jail » . ""When I tell you, Mr. Simpson, there are conditions and there are rules, let me make sure you understand if you violate those rules ... you'll be back, locked up in the Clark County Detention Center; do you understand me?"" the judge asked. ""I understand 100 percent,"" said Simpson, dressed in a navy blue jail jumpsuit. ""No contact [with others in case], no phone messages to third parties, no emails, no letters -- nothing,"" Glass added. Galanter said his client ""was truly contrite about what has occurred."" ""He will abide scrupulously by whatever this court decides,"" the attorney said. Simpson faces trial April 7 on 12 criminal counts, including conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery, burglary, coercion and assault with a deadly weapon. The charges stem from a September 13 incident at a Las Vegas hotel in which he allegedly stole sports memorabilia he said belonged to him from dealers Alfred Beardsley and Bruce Fromong. According to earlier testimony, Beardsley and Fromong were offering more than 600 Simpson-related items for sale, including ties Simpson wore during his criminal trial for the 1994 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. Simpson was acquitted in that trial. E-mail to a friend .",formal

">Please point me to which provision removed regulation on credit default swaps, which would have prevented the crisis. First, are you really arguing that deregulation of derivatives didnt play a role in the crisis? And um, credit default swaps caused the crisis? Do you even know what a credit default swap is? Its almost like youre just throwing words together in an attempt to arrive at a coherent sounding argument. Because it should be obvious that credit defaults swaps didnt cause the crisis, just by the definition of the term. Credit default swaps are what sank AIG. But they didnt cause the crisis. A credit default swap is essentially insurance on a financial security. If the issuer of the bond thats insured defaults, you get paid by the agency that you insured it with (probably AIG). CDS's didnt cause the crisis. I mean, just ask yourself, *why* did the insured securities default in the first place?? *That,* the reason why the default happened, is what caused the crisis. And the failure to regulate derivatives *directly* ties in with CDS. In the derivative market, where people are making bets on the value of a MBS without actually owning it, any number of people can take out a credit default swap on an MBS. Its like your neighbor taking insurance out on your house and then burning it down. There was no regulation there when common sense overwhelmingly indicated that there should be. >Blah, blah, blah. This isn't why people in my town bought multiple condos for $400,000 a piece, when they could only rent then out for $15,000/yr. Anybody settling for a Bush didn't hold a gun to their head and force them to sign their mortgages. Obviously not. But you're basically acting like housing policy and financial regulation had nothing to do with the crisis, and thats just wrong. Just because bush didnt hold a gun to someones head and make them take out a mortgages doesnt mean his policies and the policies of his party didnt cause it. >Without this, it's impossible for any of the other shit to have happened. Remember, cause, not symptom. You should really be telling yourself that, Mr. Credit-Default-Swaps-Cause-the-Crisis. Exactly what do you think I've got backwards? >The number of regulators at the SEC grew substantially under Bush. I can't find the chart now. Will look for it. I dont know the number youre referring to, you could be right considering government employment surged under bush. but thats not my argument. Sure there might have been more regulators, they just werent doing their job. And thats exactly what i said. >Sure, it doesn't help when the Democrat spawned agencies continue to create a market for subprime mortgages by buying them on the secondary market. Maybe it wasn't a huge amount, but still encouraged banks to continue to make risky loans. How did they make the market more risky when [default rates on fannie and freddie mortages were between 4 - 5.5 percent at their worst,]( while [default rates on mortgages issued by commercial banks reached more than 11%?]( This one is really important, it goes directly to your point that fannie and freddie (and the community reinvestment act that concerned them) made the market more risky. [Loans by banks regulated by the CRA had lower default rates]( Furthermore, [the vast majority of loans issued during the crisis were issued by private banks]( So no, fannie and freddie and the CRA did not increase risk. In fact their default rates pretty conclusively prove that they were some of the safest institutions in the market. >The recovery is meager at best. Look at how much cash corporations are sitting on. The recovery is dependent on deleveraging. It could all have happened at once, or gradually. Maybe the stimulus helped soften the fall. But it's a natural cycle, that had to take its course either way. Speaking of deleveraging, this is another place where obama has overseen a [tremendous recovery.]( How exactly is this recovery meager at best?? Private employment and GDP are both growing at the same pace they grew during the recovery in bush's first term. Corporate profits are at record highs. The dow has doubled. Manufacturing hasnt grown this much in decades. And even if it has been meager, which it hasnt, the american jobs act would have created 1.4 million jobs and your party blocked it! Not to mention all of the austerity and layoffs at the state level decreasing aggregate demand and increasing unemployment Its quite obvious that you've reached your own conclusion about how you think the world works without first looking at the facts. Usually people, at least smart people, look at the facts and then make their opinions based on those facts. But you, not you. You've obviously made your decision based on your inherent biases. And then you went out and tried to find data that backs up your bias, and ignored any data that contradicted it. **TL;DR** You dont seem to know what a credit default swap is. Refusal to regulate derivatives along with the repeal of glass steagal both played significant roles in the crisis. Fannie and freddie were among the safest institutions in the market. The recovery has actually been fairly robust, and the reason its not stronger is mostly because of republicans in congress and in state and local legislatures.",informal

"SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Firefighters in Southern California are facing wind-whipped walls of flame from 15 wildfires that have scorched more than 400,000 acres and forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes. Firefighters battle the Witch fire Tuesday in the Del Dios area of Escondido, California. The blazes have killed one person and injured at least 70 more. Firefighters were aided by resources from Mexico, the state and federal governments and even inmates from California's prisons. San Diego Fire Department Battalion Chief Bruce Cartelli described scenes of ""utter devastation"" with hundreds of homes lost and ""many hundreds"" of others damaged. ""It's probably the worst significant event in my career of 36 years,"" he said. ""It will not end ... until it reaches the ocean or the winds turn around,"" Cartelli said. Meteorologists suggested that Santa Ana winds, which have fueled the wildfires with some gusts approaching 100 mph, could die down Wednesday afternoon. ""We are still facing some very serious fires,"" Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said after an aerial tour of the affected area. ""The weather has made it very difficult for the air assets to get up and fight the fires. ... If the weather cooperates, maybe we can turn the tide tomorrow."" Officials have evacuated nearly 350,000 homes in San Diego County alone, where the worst of the fires are blazing. Using U.S. Census Bureau numbers from the 2000 census, that could mean as many as 950,000 were affected by the fires. Watch evacuees shaken, firefighters battling » . In San Diego County, at least half a million residents had been ordered to find refuge in shelters, schools and stadiums as fires pushed into new areas. Among the evacuees as more than 4,000 military personnel from several bases in the area. With the winds pushing them across the area, the fires spread quickly, forcing some residents to flee in the middle of the night. ""My wife woke me up like 12 o'clock, screaming and yelling that the flames were coming down,"" said Johnny Villanueva of Spring Valley, who fled with his wife and daughter to San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, which is serving as a shelter to more than 12,000 evacuees. ""We just loaded up the car really quick and came down here ... slept in our vehicles."" His wife, Elizabeth, added, ""I saw on the mountain on fire, and said, 'Oh my God, my family. ... Let's go."" With Qualcomm Stadium being used by the evacuees, the San Diego Chargers planned to practice at the Arizona Cardinals' stadium in Glendale for next weekend's game. Lake Arrowhead resident Michelle Dresser, who owns a business and was chased from her home by a wildfire last year, said she was waiting until the last minute to leave. She spent the night in her store, partly to help customers and neighbors. ""It is crazy. We are surrounded by fire on both sides,"" she said. Asked by CNN where she would go, she replied, ""I have to find someplace to accept two dogs, two cats and a turtle."" Watch people staying with pets at refuge » . Animals are allowed in Qualcomm Stadium, a nearby field and Del Mar Fairgrounds and Racetrack. President Bush is scheduled to visit the area on Thursday, the White House said. Chertoff arrived in San Diego Tuesday afternoon for a ""first-hand look"" at the devastation. ""I wanted to see for myself, first of all, how the shelter situation is in San Diego, what the fires look like up close,"" Chertoff told CNN. The secretary said that the federal response to the wildfires is ""phenomenally better"" than the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, ""because we have been preparing and planning and training together for the last 2 ½ years."" ""Unlike in Katrina ... we have now built the process ... and we've rehearsed it, so when we take the field, the team already knows what we need to do,"" he said. See photos of the fires » . And the scene at Qualcomm Stadium on Tuesday did seem to live up to Chertoff's expectations as volunteers cheerily handed out chairs, food and water. Thirty-four firefighters have been injured, authorities said. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he was ""heartbroken"" after touring the Lake Arrowhead area, where the Grass Valley and Slide fires have burned 5,000 acres and destroyed more than 200 homes. ""This is a tragedy, what is happening in California,"" he told reporters. The combination of dry terrain, searing heat and hammering winds had created ""the perfect storm for fire,"" the governor said. Schwarzenegger said about 7,000 firefighters were battling the blazes, including 2,300 inmates from California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders said the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, had sent four fire engines and their crews to help out, and the governor of Baja California had offered help. Chertoff said cots, blankets, water and other supplies have been moved where they are needed, and more are coming. The Federal Emergency Management Agency delivered 25,000 cots to Qualcomm early Tuesday. At least 150 National Guard members are assigned to provide security at the stadium. See where the fires are burning » . Of San Diego County's 10 major fires, the Witch fire in the north, which has grown to 200,000 acres, is the priority because of its significant threat to structures, said Ron Lane, the county's director of emergency services. The Harris fire had burned more than 70,000 acres by mid-morning. In northern Los Angeles County, the Ranch, Buckweed, and Magic fires have charred more than 93,000 acres and fire officials fear they could merge. ""We want to keep these fires as small as we can,"" said Capt. Barry Parker of the Ventura County Fire Department. The 54,500-acre Ranch fire was only two miles away from the 1,200-acre Magic fire. The blazes are straddling the L.A.-Ventura County line. Asked if he had enough resources, Parker said, ""We truly don't."" ""We're using a limited amount of resources to go in and fight these fires,"" he said. ""We've got about 600 people on the Ranch fire; we normally would have about 1,500. ""So we have to be absolutely surgical in how we plan and how we tactically use our fire equipment because we just simply don't have enough fire engines in the state of California to battle these blazes."" In San Diego County, a utility spokesman said a 500,000-volt transmission line was damaged when the Harris fire expanded, and it will be out of service until at least Wednesday. Other transmission lines have been destroyed. Sanders said Mexico's Federal Electrical Commission was providing power to the area's grid to help make up for the losses. California also received extensive offers of manpower and equipment from the military. A total of 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego, and 67 Defense Department employees -- 12 firefighting teams -- already were engaged. Eleven Defense Department helicopters equipped with water buckets and more than 17,000 National Guardsmen were available, along with six C-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant on the flames. But aerial attacks on the fires have been limited by the fierce Santa Ana winds. The Red Cross and other groups also were in the wings. They and some other groups were waiting for the flames to die down before bringing in their volunteers. The Red Cross has set up 11 shelters in the area and housed 3,000 people Monday night. More were expected Tuesday. A firefighter at Rancho Bernardo in San Diego County showed distress. ""Every one of us out here feels like these homes are our own. We know what it's like to see people's faces when they've lost everything. It's devastating to see so much of this all at once."" E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There is ""no remaining hope"" of finding six men trapped for almost a month in a Utah coal mine alive, a federal official said Saturday. Isaac Arellano holds a candle and sings during a fundraiser for miners Tuesday in Price, Utah. ""Over the past 25 days, the Mine Safety and Health Administration has exhausted all known options in our attempt to reach the six miners,"" Richard Stickler, head of the agency, said in a statement. ""The thoughts and prayers of the dedicated professionals at MSHA are with the families."" Sympathy for the failed efforts also came Saturday from the White House. ""Last night, a difficult decision was made to end the search,"" President Bush said in a statement. ""Laura and I are deeply saddened by this tragedy and continue to pray for the families of these men."" Labor Secretary Elaine Chao called the ordeal ""heartbreaking."" ""The grueling around-the-clock rescue operation that claimed three lives and injured six others has also taken a tremendous toll on the many brave rescuers and the local community, and our thoughts and prayers are with them all,"" Chao said in a statement. After drilling seven holes into mine tunnels from the mountaintop above, there has been no sign of the miners -- and microphones have picked up no sound from the men. See a timeline of rescue efforts » . Tests showed underground oxygen levels were too low to sustain human life. ""We basically told the families that at this point in time we've run out of options,"" Stickler said at a news conference late Friday. ""We've consulted with the people that we have here, we've consulted with the technical support in Pittsburgh and we've consulted with private consultants in terms of where we can go,"" he said. ""And basically, through all the information we've gleaned over the past nearly four weeks in terms of the conditions we found, in terms of the air readings we found down there and ... everything else, we just don't know where else we can put a hole to get any other information."" See photos of the rescue mission » . There were no public statements Saturday from Bob Murray, president and CEO of Murray Mining, co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine, who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view. Federal officials became the spokesmen. No one from Murray Mining was present at Friday's news conference. ""They are done. It's finished,"" the attorney for the families said, according to the Saturday edition of The Salt Lake Tribune. ""It's a hard and bitter pill for our families, and there were quite a few tears shed,"" the newspaper quotes Colin King as saying. The men were trapped during a collapse on August 6, and it is not known whether they survived the cave-in. Efforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed, and six people were injured in a second collapse as they tried to tunnel horizontally toward the area where the men had been working. Murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole. Under pressure from the families, however, he agreed to try one more time. Families wanted officials to drill a hole large enough to send down a rescue capsule. The effort to lower the robotic device down a seventh hole had been called ""a long shot"" by an official. MSHA's Stickler said that hole was drilled into the Crandall Canyon Mine on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it. Work resumed Friday, this time at the fourth hole, but the camera could only descend about 7 feet, he said. ""Basically, what it saw was really not that much. There was quite a bit of mud in there, water coming down the hole. It really couldn't go any farther than seven feet,"" he said of the latest try. In addition, the roof was sagging. ""The families asked many, many questions and we answered them all the best we could, basically coming to the conclusion that we had run out of options."" Murray said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine. ""I will never come back to that evil mountain,"" he said. Friends and family have identified the six missing miners as Luis Hernandez, Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips and Don Erickson. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"Media playback is not supported on this device All the tries came in the second half with Liam Williams and Gareth Davies crossing as Wales twice opened an eight-point lead. But Juan Martin Hernandez and Martin Landajo both scored as the Pumas refused to lie down. Full-back Leigh Halfpenny's 78th-minute penalty edged Wales four points clear to settle the encounter. The Toulon full-back scored 14 points with the boot, which ultimately proved the difference between the sides in a match which did not quite live up to expectations. Read: Wales restored pride, says Howley Howley praises 'world class' lock Jones Following their 32-8 defeat by Australia the previous week, Wales were relieved to hang on against a Pumas side that refused to buckle in the face of extreme pressure. After coach Rob Howley had asked for a response from his team, man of the match Alun Wyn Jones and wing Williams - who both missed the Wallabies defeat - made a huge impact on their returns. Williams' determination for his try typified a full-blooded display by the Scarlets back. Argentina failed to rediscover the exciting running which saw them beat Ireland at the same stadium in the 2015 World Cup. And while Howley would be pleased with the improvement in Wales' performance, a lack of composure in attack, particularly when they were on top in the first half, will be a concern. Wales controlled the opening period but, apart from two penalties by Halfpenny, had little to show for their dominance at the break as Argentina repeatedly infringed in their own 22. When referee Angus Gardner finally lost patience and sent prop Ramiro Herrera to the sin-bin with a minute of the first half remaining, Wales were promptly penalised at the next scrum and went in with a three-point lead which barely reflected the run of play. Media playback is not supported on this device After the break, wing Williams produced a tenacious finish to edge Wales eight points clear before Landajo's opportunism from a quick penalty created a try for the superb Hernandez. When Davies dummied over for his eighth international try and Halfpenny converted, it looked as though Wales would pull clear. But the Pumas, with Sanchez a probing threat at fly-half, hit back again when Landajo was given the benefit of the doubt by television official Sean Davey. An exchange of penalties meant Wales led by a point before Halfpenny eased the nerves with his fifth successful kick of the game.

"(CNN) -- If someone had asked Kelly Pless to describe herself three years ago, the word ""fit"" would have never crossed her mind. Kelly Pless weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest. She lost 95 pounds through diet and exercise. For most of her adult life, the 31-year-old graduate student from Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, has struggled with her weight. She started gaining as a teenager and by the time she graduated from high school, she was carrying 215 pounds on her 5' 2"" frame. Prom, she says, was a nightmare. ""I had to go to three different stores to buy a dress,"" Pless said. ""I had to buy the biggest, also the ugliest, prom dress the store had because it was the only one that would fit."" After high school, she lost 50 pounds. But because she hadn't done it in a healthy way, her weight crept back up to 220 pounds. At 28, she started having trouble breathing and doctors told her the weight was to blame. She reached her breaking point. ""I remember being heavy and feeling like being fit just wasn't something I could be,"" said Pless. ""I remember feeling like even if I tried, it wasn't something my body was capable of."" Despite her doubts, Pless decided to do something. Fortunately she didn't have to look far for inspiration. See before and after weight loss photos from CNN.com I-Reporters » . ""My manager at the Kennedy Space Center ran marathons, and he was the same age as my father,"" she said. Because her own father had diabetes and was in poor health, he seemed much older, she said. Over the next three to four months, she began walking, without any real goal or expectation. Pless believed that if she just focused on eating less and moving more, everything would fall into place. ""At first, it was hard to start exercising because I was worried people would make fun of me,"" Pless said. ""But then I just told myself, if that's the worst that could happen ... I just got out there and didn't care."" Eventually, she started to run or ""shuffle"" as she jokingly recalls. She also adopted an ""eat to live"" philosophy and satisfied her cravings for sweets by eating lots of fruit. ""I changed how I felt about food and what it meant to me,"" said Pless, who occasionally indulges in a bite of birthday cake or a piece of chocolate. ""One of the first things I cut out was cakes and cookies. That was my weak spot. After a few months of cutting those things out, I focused more on portion control,"" said Pless. ""I pretty much eat when I'm hungry and don't eat when I'm not and really try to pay attention to when those times are. Make sure I'm not eating out of boredom or [at] social events, I try to make sure I'm not overeating, just because everyone else is."" Kelly Pless shares her weight loss secrets » . Pless pays close attention to societal pressure, which she believes is the reason many people overeat. Restaurant servings are about three times bigger than a normal portion size, she says. She makes sure she doesn't overeat when dining out simply because the food is there. ""What's hard is to change how you feel about foods that you love or that aren't necessarily good for you, or actually change how you look at food. That was the hardest part for me."" Instead of giving in to the temptation or convenience of calorie-laden or fatty foods such as cheeseburgers from the drive-through, Pless asks herself, ""What do I really want to eat? Or, what does my body really want right now?"" All of the hard work and determination paid off. Pless has lost 95 pounds and kept it off for 1½ years. As a result, she says, she's healthier and more confident. She's also set a new professional goal -- to pursue a doctorate in food and exercise psychology -- so she can help others who are battling obesity and eating disorders. ""[The] negative side to weight loss is that people treat people differently. Being fat was a good filter -- I'm automatically treated better by people because I'm thinner. Society is so hard on people who are overweight or obese,"" said Pless. ""Now, those people think I'm funnier or smarter."" Pless runs about 40 miles a week while she trains for two marathons she plans to run this winter. The first is in November in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the second is in Miami, Florida, in January. Forty pounds ago, the first thing she wanted to do once she lost the weight was to have a tummy tuck to remove all of the loose skin. But now, she said she can't imagine taking the break from running that recovering from surgery would require. ""Running has become a constant for me and does so much more for me than maintain my weight, which is now about 125 pounds,"" said Pless. If her past is any indication of her future success, Pless will certainly cross the finish line. I-Report: Have you lost weight? Share your story, tips and photos E-mail to a friend .",formal

"Great image, but I'm not 100% certain I agree. It's easy to say ""I rebelled, why didn't you?"" But often the facts of the matter are that when you grow up in an environment full of certain messages, you're likely to end up believing those as true (Go to college if you want a life, have kids, get a 9-5 job and be responsible, etc). It's not at all fair to blame people for listening to the things they have been told *their entire lives,* just because you had the insight to realize it's bullshit and escape from it. Rather, we need to start challenging the messages. We don't get anything other than a smug sense of superiority by blaming people and saying ""Oh? You're miserable because you had kids? Well, that's what you get for just buying into the kids = happy crap."" We instead need to encourage people to think their decisions through like we (presumably) have done, so that they can come to their own conclusions about what is best for them, rather than what society says is best for them. tldr; Don't blame miserable parents for not realizing they'd be miserable, blame the culture that told them they wouldn't be.",informal

"(CNN) -- Filmmaker Michael Moore, whose new documentary ""Sicko"" takes on America's health care system, faced off Tuesday with CNN chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Michael Moore and CNN's Sanjay Gupta argued Tuesday about Gupta's report on Moore's film ""Sicko"" Moore criticized a report Gupta did on CNN Monday on ""Sicko."" ""He said the facts were fudged,"" Moore said, referring to Gupta, on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""That's a lie. None of the facts are fudged."" Moore and Gupta shouted and argued over data Gupta used and data Moore used. Moore said his staffers backed up the film's facts to Gupta before the report aired and that Gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong. Gupta disputed that. Watch Moore, Gupta make their points » . ""We try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find,"" he said. ""Michael has a lot of different numbers. ... You're sort of cherry-picking data from different reports."" Both agreed, however, on the basic premise of ""Sicko"": Problems abound in America's health-care system and need to be fixed. ""I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that,"" Gupta said. ""I think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it's broken. We get it."" He praised Moore for raising awareness of the issue. However, Gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as France and Canada have universal health care --suggests that health care in those countries is free. While patients may not pay for services at the doctor's office, they do pay high taxes to fund such a system, something Gupta said he was concerned that ""Sicko"" audiences might not realize. Moore responded by saying Americans pay more in copays, deductibles and insurance premiums. ""We [America] have a system built on profit,"" the moviemaker said. He asked Gupta if the current system, which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures, is cumbersome to him. ""It's a shameful system, especially when I'm dealing with some of my patients,"" Gupta said. But he questioned Moore's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the Bush administration, which Moore fiercely criticized in the past, particularly in his film ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" ""The government actually used to do things right,"" Moore said in response. ""The problem is who we put in power."" Moore has adamantly opposed the war in Iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war's success abounded in Washington. ""I am sorry we've taken so much time trying to correct [Gupta's] facts here tonight instead of talking about the real issue"" -- the ailing health care system, Moore said.

"French PM Manuel Valls and US Secretary of State John Kerry said civilians were dying in Russian air strikes. Russian PM Dmitry Medvedev said there was ""no evidence of our bombing civilians, even though everyone is accusing us of this"". One observers' group says at least 1,015 civilians have been killed in Russian air strikes. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said late last month that close to a quarter of those killed were under the age of 18. How Putin is succeeding in Syria Displaced Syrians struggle to survive Syria: The story of the conflict Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has consistently denied hitting civilian targets and insists it is battling terrorists. Mr Valls said his government ""respects Russia and Russia's interests"" but ""that to re-discover the path to peace, to discussion, the Russian bombing of civilians has to stop"". Mr Kerry again accused Russia of using so-called 'dumb bombs' in Syria that do not hit precise targets. Last week, he said women and children were being killed ""in large numbers"" by Russian raids. Mr Medvedev said Russia was ""not trying to achieve some secret goals in Syria"", adding that ""we are trying to protect our national interests"". Their comments were made at a security conference in Munich, days after world powers agreed a deal to push for a cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week. Agreement to try to bring about a cessation of hostilities and allow more access for humanitarian aid was reached by world powers late on Thursday in Germany, but neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved. Under the plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria. Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria. The halt will not apply to the battle against jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front. The tentative deal reached here in Munich to pause the fighting in Syria was always going to be a tough sell to the warring parties on the ground. Now its chances of success look even slimmer - ""Forty-nine per cent,"" said Russia's foreign minister. ""Closer to zero,"" said his British counterpart. For much of the day the Russian and Western ministers have been trading accusations and counter-accusations as to who is to blame for the ongoing misery that is the Syrian civil war. France, Britain and the US all accused Russia of targeting mainstream rebels and civilians with air strikes while leaving so-called Islamic State largely unscathed. Russia flatly denied this, saying most of those civilians were being besieged by rebels rather than by Assad's forces. Again, Western delegates disagreed. So there are clearly two, diametrically opposed, versions of what is going on in Syria. That leaves little prospect of the concerted effort for peace by all parties that is so desperately needed. Rebel groups in Syria have told the BBC they would not stop fighting because they do not believe that Russia will end its bombing campaign in support of the government. They also reiterated their demand that President Assad be removed from power. On Friday, the president said he wanted to retake ""the whole country"" from rebels. But US state department spokesman Mark Toner said Mr Assad was ""deluded"" if he thought there was a military solution to the conflict. Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo. More than 250,000 people have been killed and some 11 million displaced in almost five years of fighting in Syria. In another sign of the complexity of the conflict, reports said that on Saturday Turkish forces had shelled Kurdish militia targets in Aleppo provinces. The Kurdish fighters had seized territory from Islamists in recent days. Turkey views the Kurdish militia as allied to the PKK group, which has a waged a campaign against Turkish security forces for decades. On Saturday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Saudi Arabia would send war planes to the Turkish air base of Incirlik, from where they would attack militants in Syria from the so-called Islamic State. Saudi Arabia is already part of the international coalition against IS. Mr Cavusoglu also said it was possible that troops from his country and Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS forces. The US has so far ruled out a ground invasion. Moscow has warned against any new foreign ground intervention in the country, saying such a development could even lead to a world war. Why is there a war in Syria? Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, five years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory. Who is fighting whom? Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called ""moderate"" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. How has the world reacted? Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.",formal

"CHEBARKUL, Russia (Reuters) -- President Vladimir Putin said on Friday security threats had forced Russia to revive the Soviet-era practice of sending bomber aircraft on regular patrols beyond its borders. A Russian strategic bomber flies over an airfield outside Moscow during an air show. Putin said 14 strategic bombers had taken off simultaneously from airfields across Russia in the early hours of Friday on long-range missions. ""We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis,"" Putin told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with China and four Central Asian states in Russia's Ural mountains. ""Today, August 17 at 00:00 hours, 14 strategic bombers took to the air from seven airfields across the country, along with support and refueling aircraft ... From today such patrols will be carried out on a regular basis. ""We hope our partners will treat this with understanding."" At U.S. President George W. Bush's Texas ranch, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to the United States. ""Militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities, so this is not entirely surprising,"" he said. But the sorties are likely to add to Western concern about Russia's growing assertiveness. That trend has prompted some U.S. policymakers to draw parallels with the Cold War. Putin caused a stir this year by saying Russian missiles would once again be aimed at targets in Europe if Washington persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern Europe. Russian diplomats have clashed with the United States and European governments on issues such as Kosovo, energy, and Moscow's treatment of its ex-Soviet neighbors. Western military leaders have said this year that Russian flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period. One Western defense official called the flights ""a little bit of chest-pounding, trying to let people know Russia is back in the game"". Putin said that when Russia had cut its flights in 1992, other military powers had not reciprocated. ""Flights by other countries' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of the Russian Federation,"" Putin said. That appeared to be a swipe at the U.S. and NATO, whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long-range missions. As Putin spoke to reporters and television cameras, four Russian military helicopters appeared and hovered in the background while Russian tanks trundled behind him, even though the exercises had ended long before. During the Cold War, Russian long-range bombers, which can carry strategic nuclear weapons, played elaborate games of cat-and-mouse with Western air forces. Earlier this month Russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the Pacific island of Guam, where the U.S. military has a base, and ""exchanged smiles"" with U.S. pilots scrambled to track them. The Pentagon said the Russian aircraft had not come close enough to U.S. ships to prompt American aircraft to react. In July, two Russian Tu-95 ""Bear"" bombers made unusually long sorties over the North Sea, leading Norway and Britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them. Russia's air force said later it was a routine flight. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- The commander of the nuclear-powered submarine USS Hampton has been relieved of his command amid an inquiry into misconduct by crew members, the U.S. Navy said Friday. The USS Hampton appears in an undated photograph. Cmdr. Michael B. Portland lost his post ""due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command,"" the Navy said in a statement. Cmdr. William J. Houston will replace Portland. The crew neither maintained inspection records nor conducted the required inspection of chemical levels associated with the cooling system of the ship's nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. The crew then went back and falsified existing records to make it appear the work had been done. ""There is not, and never was, any danger to the crew or the public,"" the Navy said. Portland's demotion brings to 10 the number of people relieved of duty on the submarine in the wake of the misconduct probe. Six personnel have been punished for forging inspection records for the cooling system, the Navy officials said Monday. Those six -- one officer and five enlisted personnel -- received a ""nonjudicial punishment"" after other Navy personnel discovered their actions, the officials said. The Navy said Friday that one officer and two enlisted crew members have been temporarily reassigned to Submarine Squadron 11. Portland also will be temporarily reassigned to that squadron. The misconduct was discovered September 17 but not made public until after completion of an initial inquiry. A fact-finding investigation is under way, and further action against Navy crew members is possible, a Navy official said. The Hampton remains in port in San Diego, California.

Officer Kenny was responding to an emergency call about a man obstructing traffic who had allegedly been involved in an assault, when he confronted Robinson. On the night of the shooting, Robinson had various illicit drugs in his system, according to autopsy reports. His friends who made multiple 911 calls said he was ""acting crazy"" and tried to choke one of them. They said he attacked people on the sidewalk and was running in front of cars, Mr Ozanne said. Mr Kenny drew his firearm before entering the apartment building Robinson was in and he claims he was attacked by Robinson at the top of the stairs. He said he feared he would be knocked down the stairs and Robinson would take his gun, and he fired seven shots at him. But Mr Robinson's relatives, and many of the Wisconsin protesters, insist he is a victim of police brutality. ""My decision won't bring him back, it will not end the racial disparities that exist in justice system,"" said Mr Ozanne. ""It is not based on emotion, rather the facts as they have been investigated and reported to me, guided by the rule of law.""",formal

"SUSSEX, Virginia (CNN) -- Suspended NFL quarterback Michael Vick must adhere to tightened restrictions after he tested positive for marijuana use, a federal judge said Wednesday. Suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick tested positive for marijuana in a September 13 drug test. Vick tested positive for the drug on September 13, a court document from the Eastern District of Virginia shows. As a result, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson ordered Vick to ""submit to any method of testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer for determining whether the defendant is using a prohibited substance."" Those methods could include random drug testing, a remote alcohol testing system ""and/or any form of prohibited substance screening or testing,"" the order said. Vick, 27, must participate in substance abuse therapy and mental health counseling ""if deemed advisable by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer"" at his own expense, the order said. Vick was also ordered to stay home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., ""or as directed by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer,"" the order said. He is to be electronically monitored during that time. The conditions are to apply until Vick's sentencing, which is set for December 10. Read about the federal case against Vick » . ""This is a very difficult time for Mr. Vick,"" said Billy Martin, Vick's lead defense counsel, in a written statement. ""He will comply with the court's new conditions regarding release."" Vick faces a possible prison term of 12 to 18 months after his August guilty plea to federal conspiracy charges related to dogfighting on his property in Surry County, Virginia. The original terms of the pretrial release, set in July by U.S. Magistrate Dennis W. Dohnal, required that Vick not use narcotic drugs or other controlled substances unless prescribed by a doctor. Vick's guilty plea in the federal case came after three associates -- Purnell Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Quanis Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Tony Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia -- admitted their roles in the operation and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. On Tuesday, a Virginia grand jury indicted Vick and the three co-defendants on state charges of running a dogfighting ring at the home. See a timeline of the case against Vick » . The Surry County grand jury brought two charges against Vick: one count of unlawfully torturing and killing dogs and one of promoting dogfights. Each is a felony charge that could result in a five-year prison term. Vick will be arraigned October 3 in state court in Virginia. Vick's attorneys say they are fighting the state charges on the grounds that he can't be convicted twice of the same crime. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Eric Fiegel contributed to this report.",formal

"(Mental Floss) -- They say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by self-loathing. But not for these folks! Long before the Material Girl ordered papa to stop preaching, these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose. Alfred Hitchcock didn't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors. Here's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form. Alfred Hitchcock . Hitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema. And, like many greats, he wasn't exactly the best collaborator. Hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work. But he was notoriously hard on actors. He was once quoted as saying, ""Actors are cattle"" -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry (actors can be so touchy). In response, he issued this correction: ""I have been misquoted. What I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'"" Although it began accidentally (when he was short an actor for the film ""The Lodger""), Hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films, amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career. Ayn Rand . The egotist's egotist, author Ayn Rand (born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum) is the patron saint of Thinking You're Better Than Everybody Else. Her most famous novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, are massive dramatizations of Objectivism, her self-spun Oscar-the-Grouch philosophy for success. Objectivism champions ego and accomplishment, shuns all religion as folly, and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society. Rand's novels often focus on protagonists (invariably men) who are shunned by others because of their genius, but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant. Not surprisingly, she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as ""spitting in your own face."" So, just how much did Rand believe in her own philosophy? Let's just say a lot. With signature modesty, she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Orson Welles . When you create a cinematic masterpiece such as ""Citizen Kane"" at the ripe old age of 25, you're bound to get a big head. But Welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that. In fact, ""Citizen Kane"" might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego. After all, it's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst because Hearst slighted Welles at a dinner party. Of course, after the unparalleled success of ""Citizen Kane,"" Welles's arrogant side didn't get any less subtle. Do yourself a favor: Track down a recording of Welles' outtakes for a TV commercial for frozen peas. You'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker's oversized ego. A classic quote goes: ""In the depths of your ignorance, what is it you want?"" Frank Lloyd Wright . As the brains behind the Robie House, Fallingwater, Taliesin West, the Guggenheim, and countless other design benchmarks, Frank Lloyd Wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture. And, boy, did he know it! Wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals. In fact, the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him. But when you're Wright, you're right. In 1935, department store magnate Stanley Marcus (of Neiman-Marcus fame) commissioned the architect to design his Dallas home, but the project quickly went sour. Wright's avant-garde floor plan included ""sleeping porches"" that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round. In addition, Marcus' small bedroom ""cubicles"" came equipped with almost no closet space. When Stanley respectfully explained that (a) temperatures during summer nights in Dallas often exceed 80 degrees and (b) a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets, Wright threw a series of tantrums. Fortunately for the voyeur in us all, said tantrums usually took place in letter form. Preserved and occasionally displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art, they make for delicious reading. Salvador Dalí . ""Every morning when I awake, the greatest of joys is mine: that of being Salvador Dalí."" Yup, he actually said that. Everything about the legendary Surrealist painter (he of the melting clocks) -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock, destroy convention, cause scandal, and stir controversy. Criticized for choosing to live under General Franco's fascist government in Spain, Dalí defended his position by stating that he didn't care about others so long as he could be king. Not exactly a man of the people. If he wasn't getting enough attention, he was known to walk the streets of New York City clanging a hand bell. Of course, this is also the guy who once said, ""The thought of not being recognized [is] unbearable."" Need another telling quote? ""At the age of 6 years, I wanted to be a chef. At the age of 7, I wanted to be Napoleon. My ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since."" Apparently, so did his ego. Al Jolson . Plenty of performers this side of Gallagher have been labeled ""the world's greatest entertainer."" But Al Jolson really, really believed it. The vaudeville singer, actor, dancer, and comedian was born Asa Yoelson in Seredzius, Lithuania, in what was then part of Imperial Russia. As a performer, he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows, ad-libbing, or just stopping to talk to the audience. During a 1911 performance of the critically hated ""Paris is a Paradise for Coons"" (title not edited for political correctness), Jolson stopped and asked the audience if they'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play. The crowd roared with applause, and Jolson ditched the whole program and took over. From that moment on, no one else could share the stage with him. Unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list, however, Jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance. According to most contemporary accounts, he actually was the greatest in the world. But, despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen, Jolson's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface (considered highly offensive now, but pretty common at the time).

"Pros: Cool fall and spring, moderate summers, SNOW!!! It snows in the winter, wide selection of dining options, expansive amount of resources for freshmen and undergrads, smaller class sizes, hundreds of official clubs, including club sports like Karate, Youn Wha Ryu, Roller Derby, Water Polo, USA Archery, Badjakcs (dance), Ultimate Frisbee, Quidditch, Scooting, as well as non-sport clubs and organizations, like the Anime club, Philosophy club, ASNAU (Student Gov't), PRISM (People Respecting Individuals and Sexual Minorities), and a group for just about every foreign language, political interest, and religion imaginable. Cons: wind. Just the fucking wind. Summers are a little warmer than what people expect (80-85 during the day), Construction projects - there's always something happening somewhere, buses are packed when it starts getting cold b/c nobody wants to walk. Things you should know: 1) If you drink or do other drugs, be discrete about it. If you don't cause trouble or blow your horn about drinking, you won't get into trouble. You should also know that NOBODY can enter your dorm room without your permission. An RA can open up and see if you're okay if he or she suspects you are in need of serious medical attention, service workers can enter when you are gone to affect repairs on internet, plumbing, electric, etc, and you must open up for Police IF AND ONLY IF they have a warrant for your arrest/search/seizure of property. THAT BEING SAID, do not abuse these benefits of living on campus. Be considerate to your neighbors and uniformed officials. Be respectful of those around you and be responsible for your actions. 2) You're going to get a lanyard. Don't. fucking. wear it. Put that shit away. Nobody wants to see your I.D. hanging from your neck, and everybody hates that you have your life attached to it, with the end hanging out of your pocket. Both of these are dumb-ass moves to pull. Don't be an obvious freshman. Put your I.D. in your wallet/purse and put your keys in your pocket. 3) Remember what being a freshman was like in high school? It'll be kind of like that, except you won't (hopefully) be as awkward. People will be a little more accepting of you and interested in you, but don't let that make you forget your manners or your intelligence. 4) Keep on top of due dates not only for homework, but things like exams, enrollment dates, add/drop/withdraw dates, and financial dues. Social life: My best advice is: If you want to buy your friends, join a fraternity or sorority. I'm not saying you won't meet great people, but understand that you are buying your way into a social sect. If that's not for you, see option 2: If you want to make legitimate friends (not that there's something wrong with fratbros/sorohoes), attend the club info fair and join some clubs that interest you. If you're religious, join the religious club of your choice. You also don't have to be religious to make friends who are. I'm part of NAU Chabad, the Jewish organization on campus, and I'm not even Jewish. I don't even have Jewish ancestors or relatives, to my knowledge. Talk to your classmates every day if you can, and meet all your neighbors right away. Don't be the awkward guy or girl who never says hi in the hallway and doesn't know his or her neighbors names. You live with these people. Be their friends. Good luck!!! **TL;DR:** Good weather, good community, be smart and safe, join clubs, get to know your classmates and neighbors.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Three French journalists charged in an alleged plot to kidnap African children for adoption in Europe arrived in Paris on Sunday, hours after French President Nicolas Sarkozy held emergency talks in Chad. But 14 other people remained in custody in the African nation, some facing serious charges that could send them to jail for up to 20 years. The journalists were among seven Europeans a Chadian judge released Sunday, including a Spanish flight crew, whom Sarkozy dropped off in a brief stop in Madrid on his way back from Chad. All were arrested last week after workers from Zoe's Ark -- a French-based charity group -- were accused of trying to fly 103 children out of Chad in a kidnapping and adoption operation. Watch a report on how the events unfolded » . Some of the children may never return to their families because it is too difficult to determine their backgrounds, Red Cross spokeswoman Inah Kaloga told CNN on Friday. Those who remain under arrest in Chad are six members of the French charity, four Chadians and four remaining members of the flight crew. Some face kidnapping and fraud charges. Zoe's Ark leader Eric Breteau testified Saturday to a court in the Chadian capital that the three journalists and the flight crew of seven Spaniards and a Belgian were not involved in the alleged plot, court witnesses told CNN. At least some of the flight crew are scheduled to testify before a judge on Monday. The three journalists initially had been charged with complicity in the alleged kidnapping attempt. It's not clear if the charges against them have been dropped. Watch the freed Europeans leave Chad » . In a joint news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on Sunday at Madrid's Torrejon Air Force Base, Sarkozy expressed satisfaction that some of those detained had been released. At the same time, however, he told reporters, ""We should respect the sovereignty of Chad."" Zapatero thanked Sarkozy for dropping the four Spanish flight crew members off in their home country, and thanked Chadian President Idriss Deby for allowing them to return. After his emergency talks in Chad, Sarkozy stressed the scandal would not affect the strong relations between the two countries or affect the planned deployment of a European force to protect refugees from Sudan's Darfur region who have fled to Chad and the neighboring Central African Republic. Sarkozy also said he hoped the six remaining French nationals -- all from Zoe's Ark -- would face trial in France. The charity says that the children were orphans from the Darfur region -- where the United Nations estimates 200,000 people have been killed in four years of conflict -- and that the group was taking them to host families in France. But after preliminary interviews with the children, aid agencies said Thursday it appeared most of them probably are not orphans and not from Sudan, but instead come from villages on the Chadian side of the border with Sudan. The children are staying in an Abeche orphanage while aid agencies and government officials try to find out where they came from -- a challenge hindered by the number of children, their youth, and the volatile situation in the region. A father of three of the children allegedly kidnapped told a French newspaper he put his children into the charity's care after he was told they would be educated at a school under construction in a nearby town. The Chadian man, who gave his name as Arbab, told Le Parisien on Sunday that workers from Zoe's Ark had visited his village three times. ""They never said they would take away our children,"" he told the newspaper. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Nic Robertson and Al Goodman contributed to this report.",formal
"COUNCIL DECISION of 7 June 2005 abrogating Decision 2005/136/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in the Netherlands (2005/729/EC) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(12) thereof, Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission, Whereas: (1) By Decision 2005/136/EC (1) following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, the Council decided that an excessive deficit existed in the Netherlands. (2) In accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty, the Council made a Recommendation on 2 June 2004 addressed to the Netherlands with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end. This Recommendation, in conjunction with Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (2), established a deadline of 2005 at the latest for the correction of the excessive deficit. (3) In accordance with Article 104(12) of the Treaty, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected. (4) The definitions of ‘government’ and ‘deficit’ are laid down in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure by reference to the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts, second edition. The data for the excessive deficit procedure are provided by the Commission. (5) Based on the data provided by the Commission after reporting by the Netherlands before 1 March 2005 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (3), on the subsequent reporting of revised general government accounts to Eurostat on 31 March 2005, and on the Commission services’ Spring 2005 forecast, the following conclusions are warranted: - the general government deficit is estimated at 2,3 % of GDP in 2004, compared with 3,2 % in 2003. The outcome for 2004 is in compliance with the Council recommendation issued under Article 104(7) of the Treaty, particularly as regards the reduction of the government deficit below the reference value of 3 % of GDP by 2005 at the latest. Fiscal adjustment was pursued in 2004 in the form of substantial savings measures, partly contained in the 2004 budget and partly decided in the additional consolidation package on 14 April 2004. Moreover, stronger-than-expected tax receipts and additional revenues from the sale of natural gas in response to high oil prices helped reduce the deficit, - the budgetary measures taken are geared towards securing a lasting improvement in the general government balance. For 2005, the Commission services’ Spring 2005 forecast projects a further decline in the general government deficit to 2,0 % of GDP, largely in response to savings measures, mostly of a structural nature, adding up to 0,5 % of GDP. This is in line with the official target of a deficit of 2,1 % of GDP. For 2006, the Commission services’ Spring 2005 forecast projects, based on currently known policies, a further fall in the deficit to 1,6 % of GDP, pointing to the durable correction of the budget deficit, - the budgetary consolidation will be sustained through a reduction in the cyclically adjusted deficit which is expected to reach close to balance after the excessive deficit has been corrected. In 2004, the cyclically adjusted deficit fell markedly to 1,2 % of GDP, compared to 2,0 % of GDP in 2003. The Commission services’ Spring 2005 forecast projects the cyclically adjusted deficit to further decrease in 2005 by another 0,8 % of GDP, to 0,4 % of GDP, which is close to balance, and to fall to 0,0 % of GDP in 2006, - according to the March 2005 excessive deficit procedure notification, the government debt ratio was kept below the 60 % of GDP reference value in 2004. The Commission services’ Spring 2004 forecast projects it to remain below this threshold in 2005 and 2006. (6) Decision 2005/136/EC should therefore be abrogated, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 From an overall assessment it follows that the correction of the excessive deficit situation in the Netherlands was completed in 2004, under the terms of the recommendation addressed to the Netherlands on 2 June 2004 in accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty. Article 2 Decision 2005/136/EC is hereby abrogated. Article 3 This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Done at Luxembourg, 7 June 2005.",formal

"The Scottish capital's trams began running on Saturday, after six years of disruption and cost increases. Mr Salmond cited ""considerable public concern"" over the Â£776m project, which he said had disrupted homes and businesses in Edinburgh. The problems included a dispute between the city council and its contractor. The first minister stopped short of announcing a full public inquiry, raising concerns over the timescale, and instead decided on a ""non-statutory"" option. Speaking during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Salmond said: ""I am sure that everyone in Edinburgh, and indeed all over Scotland, will be delighted to see that the Edinburgh trams are fully operational and carrying passengers. ""We cannot, however, lose sight of the considerable public concern over the conduct of the project, the disruption it has caused to households and businesses in the city of Edinburgh. ""I therefore recommended to the Cabinet, and it has been decided, to establish a judge-led public inquiry into the Edinburgh trams project to establish why the project occurred significant overruns in terms of cost and timing, requiring in particular a considerable reduction in the original scope."" He added that the government had been assured by the City of Edinburgh Council that it would fully cooperate with the inquiry. The first minister added: ""There are lessons to be learned from the conduct of the Edinburgh trams project and I think the course of action we are proposing will be a substantial assistance in doing that."" Mr Salmond was responding to a question from Marco Biagi, the SNP MSP for Edinburgh Central and an opponent of the city's trams, which run on an 8.7-mile route, from the New Town to Edinburgh Airport. ""All of us who opposed the trams project from the start as risky and over-engineered have been disappointed almost daily by being shown to be right,"" said Mr Biagi. ""Now that the trams are indeed rolling, if there is to be any faith from the public in future management or potential cost estimates for projects like this, we need to know for sure that these mistakes will never be repeated"". In the decade since the first money was allocated to the project, the price has doubled, the tram network has halved and it has taken twice as long to build as originally planned. Four years ago, a bitter dispute between Transport Edinburgh Limited, the arms-length company responsible for delivering the project, and main contractor Bilfinger Berger brought the whole project to a halt for months.",formal
"The 41-year-old reached the semi-final for the first time since he last lifted the trophy in 2011 with a 13-6 win over Kyren Wilson. The world number six will now face the winner of Stephen Maguire's match against Barry Hawkins for a place in Sunday's final. ""I believe I can [win], and that's a great feeling to have,"" Higgins said. ""I was close last year, Alan [McManus] pipped me [in the quarter-final],"" he added. ""A couple of years after 2011, I'd been losing, my form wasn't great and you don't think you're going to get back to that one-table set up. ""It's the best place in the world to get out and play and I can't wait to get into the arena tomorrow [Thursday]. I'm buzzing."" Higgins won all three sessions against Wilson, the world number 16, and believes his game has grown in strength over the course of the tournament. The Scot considers reigning champion Mark Selby as the favourite for the title, while his pre-competition tip was Hawkins. Yet Higgins is in a good place mentally as he prepares for the semi-final. ""The nerves get more difficult, but I'm more relaxed this year,"" he said. Media playback is not supported on this device ""I don't know if that's because I feel as if I'm playing OK. At this event, you need to have a few sessions when you have good, frame-winning breaks. I did that against Mark Allen and in the second session against Kyren. ""To win this event you need a couple of sessions when you're dominating the other player. I feel as if my game can be there to do that but I'm sure other players will say the same thing. ""There are some sessions, especially this year, when I couldn't have played any better. I played [Ronnie] O'Sullivan in the final of the Champions and couldn't have played any better. You've just got to hope that comes out in the big matches."" Maguire was once tipped as a potential world champion by O'Sullivan, and Hawkins said the Scot is benefitting from curbing his socialising at tournaments. Higgins would like to face his compatriot Maguire in the semi-final, because it would guarantee that a Scot will feature in Sunday's final. ""Everybody's got their own choices in life and us Scots, we maybe like a drink and there's nothing wrong with that,"" Higgins said. ""Life's too short. ""Stephen is a great player and I hope [he] comes through. If he was to beat me, I would be the first one to cheer him to win his first world title.

"The decision comes after 170,000 activists from around the world demanded action to help lesbians targeted for ""corrective rape"". The authorities have been accused of not doing enough following the recent killing and rape of lesbian activist Noxolo Nogwaza. Police say they do not consider sexual orientation when investigating murder. ""To us, murder is murder, whether somebody is Zulu, English, male or female - we don't see colour, we don't see gender,"" police ministry spokesman Zweli Mnisi told the BBC on Tuesday, after rights groups urged the police to do more to find those responsible Ms Nogwaza's death. She was stoned, stabbed and gang-raped in the KwaThema township east of Johannesburg over the Easter weekend. Unlike in many African countries, homosexual acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, but activists say gay and lesbian people are often attacked in townships. They say ""corrective rape"" - when a lesbian is raped to either punish her, or ""correct"" her behaviour - is becoming increasingly common. Ndumie Funda, founder of the gay rights organisation Luleki Sizwe which works in 10 black townships and rural areas near Cape Town, welcomed the government's announcement. She said it was important to get ""corrective rape"" classified as a hate crime. ""The South African constitution is one of the highly respected and acknowledged constitutions and it says we are all equal; we're therefore reminding our government to say that this was being promised and we voted for you so we need protection,"" she told the BBC's Network Africa programme. Luleki Sizwe started an online petition at Change.org to get the government to take action. ""In less than six months, a tiny group of township activists has mobilised more than 170,000 people from 163 countries and gotten the highest levels of government to address their basic demand, that the sadistic crime of 'corrective rape' be taken seriously,"" Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt is quoted by the Sapa news agency as saying. Justice ministry spokesman Tlali Tlali said the the task team would begin its work in July and include six representatives from the judiciary, police and department of social development and six representatives from the gay community. ""The team will be charged with developing a legislative intervention plan, a public awareness strategy, and LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex]-sensitive shelters,"" he said. In 2008, female footballer and gay rights activist Eudy Simelane was also killed in KwaThema, some 80km (50 miles) east of Johannesburg. Two people were given long prison terms for her murder and rape, although prosecutors denied that her sexuality had been a motive.",formal

"Everton had won on their last four visits to City - and for an hour frustration was in the air again as they mounted a wall of well-organised resistance that kept Roberto Mancini's side at bay. The introduction of substitute Mario Balotelli on the hour led to the breakthrough as he scored with a deflected shot after 68 minutes and finally unsettled Everton with an impressive cameo. It was the type of result and performances that adds weight to the argument that City will mount a serious title challenge this season Read more of the blog James Milner, another second-half substitute, added the second with two minutes left from David Silva's sublime pass to allow City to move top of the Premier League ahead of Manchester United's visit to Stoke City. And it was a win City deserved for demonstrating the patience and persistence they will need as Everton's dour approach is likely to be mirrored by plenty of sides who will attempt to suppress City's wide range of attacking options at Etihad Stadium. Media playback is not supported on this device Everton's tactics appeared designed to secure a draw and perhaps aim to take an isolated chance on the break. But David Moyes' side were undermined by a failure to offer anything in attack, although substitute Louis Saha - and his manager - were rightly infuriated when referee Howard Webb failed to award a free-kick when he was blatantly fouled on the edge of the area by Vincent Kompany with the game still in the balance. Moyes also believed Everton had been the victims of injustice in the build-up to Balotelli's crucial goal, claiming City were wrongly awarded a throw in. Mancini will relish the manner of this win as much as other victories earned in real style this season. Everton offered a stern test and City showed growing maturity to get the three points. Everton's superbly drilled defensive formation offered nothing other than frustration to City in the first half as they stood firm. Moyes had clearly earmarked Silva as central to City's threat and he deployed youngster Jack Rodwell to man-mark the Spaniard. And when he received a yellow card for a foul on Silva responsibility briefly switched to Phil Neville, until he drew similar punishment from referee Webb after a clash with Silva. Sergio Aguero was City's main threat in the early exchanges, but it was the 53rd minute before Everton posed a serious threat as Tim Cahill's header from Seamus Coleman's cross floated over the bar. It was only when Balotelli came on for Edin Dzeko on the hour that City made serious inroads into the Everton defence. Samir Nasri had a shot well saved by Tim Howard before the Italian broke the deadlock seven minutes after his introduction. Balotelli's finish from the edge of the area was measured and also took a decisive touch off Everton defender Phil Jagielka to send the ball tantalisingly out of Howard's reach into the bottom corner. Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors now needed to shift the entire emphasis of their approach, but City were playing with renewed confidence and Silva hit the woodwork with Howard beaten. Balotelli was then narrowly off target before setting up Silva for a tap-in, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside. Silva was at his creative best as City wrapped up the win with one minute left. Everton substitute Royston Drenthe lost possession in midfield and Silva threaded through a perfect invitation for Milner to slide his finish past Howard. Everton had offered next to nothing in terms of attacking threat, although another City substitute Stefan Savic made a timely intervention in injury time to clear Marouane Fellaini's shot off the line.

"COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2380/95 of 2 October 1995 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of plain paper photocopiers originating in Japan THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 of 22 December 1994 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Article 23 thereof, Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (2), and in particular Articles 12, 14 and 15 thereof, Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A. PROCEDURE (1) On 2 August 1985, the Commission announced the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of photo-copying apparatus originating in Japan (3). A provisional anti-dumping duty was imposed on 26 August 1986 by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2640/86 (4). On 24 February 1987, by Regulation (EEC) No 535/87 (5), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of plain paper photocopiers (hereinafter referred to as 'PPCs`) originating in Japan. At the same time, an undertaking was accepted (6) from one exporter, Kyocera, which had discontinued the production of PPCs, to give advance notice to the Commission should it decide to recommence exports to the Community. (2) Following the introduction of these measures, a number of investigations were initiated pursuant to Article 13 (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 in respect of the production or assembly of PPCs in the Community by Japanese exporters. These investigations resulted in undertakings being accepted by the Commission from exporters whose PPC models, produced or assembled in the Community, had originally been found to have a weighted average value of parts or materials of Japanese origin or more than 60 % of the total value of all parts or materials (7). (3) Following the publication in August 1991 of a notice (8) of the impending expiry of the measures in force in respect of imports from Japan, the Commission received a request for a review lodged by the Committee of European Copier Manufacturers (Cecom) allegedly on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the total Community production of PPCs. This review request was limited to PPCs with a capacity to operate at a speed of up to 75 copies per minute of A4 size paper. In accordance with Article 15 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, it contained evidence purporting to show that the expiry of the anti-dumping measures in force would again lead to injury or threat thereof. The review request also covered the undertakings given under Article 13 (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. On 16 July 1992, Cecom submitted a supplement to its review request, asking for the inclusion in the review of PPCs capable of operating at a speed of more than 75 copies per minute of A4 size paper. This supplementary request contained evidence purporting to show that such PPCs originating in Japan were being dumped and were, through the effect of dumping, causing injury to the Community industry. (4) On 14 August 1992, in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (1); the Commission announced the initiation of a review investigation in accordance with Articles 14 and 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. (5) The Commission notified the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and known producers in the Community, and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. (6) All complainant producers in the Community replied to the questionnaire and made their views known in writing. In addition, some information was received from Kodak Ltd, Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom. Almost all exporters together with their related importers and production facilities in the Community replied to the questionnaire and made their views known in writing. The only known exporters in Japan that did not reply to the questionnaire was Sanyo Electric Co., Osaka. Two other Japanese companies, Kyocera Corp., Kyoto, and Fuji Xerox Co., Tokyo, declared they had not exported PPCs to the Community during the investigation period of the review. Kyocera Corp. indicated that it had not produced PPCs since 1986 and asked to be relieved of its undertaking to give the Commission sufficient notice should it recommence exports to the Community (2). One Japanese trading company, Mitsui Co Ltd, Tokyo, also replied to the questionnaire. Three unrelated importers, Agfa Gevaert NV, Mortsel, Belgium, Infotech Europe BV, 's-the Netherlands, and Lanier Europe BV, Sassenheim, the Netherlands, replied to the questionnaire and made their views known in writing. All parties who so requested were granted a hearing. (7) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination and visited the premises of the following companies: - complainant producers in the Community: - Océ Nederland BV, with headquarters and factory in Venlo, the Netherlands, - Olivetti-Canon Industriale SpA, with headquarters and factory in Ivrea, Italy, - Rank Xerox Ltd with headquarters in Marlow, United Kingdom, and factories in Mitcheldean, United Kingdom, Venray, the Netherlands, and Lille, France; - producers/exporters in Japan: - Canon Inc., Tokyo, - Copyer Co.

(8) The investigation of dumping covered the period 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992 (investigation period). (9) Owing to the unusual complexity of a number of legal, technical and policy issues dealt with by the investigation, and the very large volume of data and submissions received from parties concerned, often requiring time limits to be extended, the investigation significantly exceeded the period of one year recommended for investigations in Article 7 (9) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. For similar reasons, it had also already taken the Commission close to six months following the end of the five-year period of operation of the original measures, 24 February 1992, to initiate this review investigation. In accordance with Article 15 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the original measures have remained in force during this entire period. (10) All parties concerned were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive measures. They were also granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to these disclosures. B. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LIKE PRODUCT 1. Product concerned (11) In accordance with Article 7 (9) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the anti-dumping proceeding which was initiated on 2 August 1985 concerning imports of photocopying apparatus originating in Japan, continues as long as the measures have not expired or been repealed or terminated. There is therefore no change in the product concerned by the proceeding. The product was defined as 'photo-copying apparatus incorporating an optical system`, 'formed by four basic elements, i.e. image processing, photo-conducting or developing, transfer or fixing and paper transport system` (1), or in short as 'plain paper photocopiers (PPCs)` (2). (12) As the name indicates, such copiers use plain paper instead of coated paper to make copies. PPCs have now almost entirely replaced coated paper copiers for normal applications. Whereas coated paper copiers use a direct process to transfer the image of an original document onto a chemically treated sheet of paper, PPCs are based on an indirect process, whereby the optical system (comprising mainly a light source, a condenser, lenses, mirrors, prisms or an array of optical fibres) projects the image of the original document onto a light-sensitive surface (usually a drum or plate). The image is then developed (often by means of a powdered dye), transferred onto ordinary paper (normally by an electrostatic field) and fixed thereon (by heat and/or pressure). Coated paper or direct process copiers, falling within CN code 9009 11 00, are therefore a product different from the PPCs which are the subject of this proceeding. PPCs often consist of several separate modules, which are assembled only at the customer's premises. In such cases, all those modules are part of the PPC, whether imported together or separately, unless they qualify as truly optional equipment not included in the standard configuration of the PPC. (13) The above product description of PPCs entails that digital copiers (black and white or full colour) do not fall within the scope of the product which is the subject of the proceeding. Even if the scanner used by a digital copier to read the original document could be considered an 'optical system`, a digital copier does not 'project` an image onto a light-sensitive surface, but rather re-composes the original image, after it has been transformed by the image processor into digital signals, into a new image, with or without changes to the original image. It is this new image which is transmitted by a laser onto a light-sensitive surface. When digital copiers are connected to computers, they are not even dependent on an original document for their input. 2. Product investigated (14) In terms of its product scope, a review investigation may cover the entire product concerned by the proceeding. For the purpose of this review it was, however, not considered necessary to investigate a number of product types which had already been exempted from the original measures and which the Community industry did not request to be included in the review. These comprised analogue full-colour copiers, aperture card reader printers and microfilm printers, whiteboard copiers and large-format copiers capable of making copies of A2 size and larger from originals larger than A2 size (1). This means that highlight PPCs, which reproduce only a few colours to draw attention to certain segments of a document, and A2 PPCs, capable of making A2 size copies (but not larger) from A2 size originals or larger, were included in the review investigation. (15) PPCs capable of operating at a speed of more than 75 copies per minute of A4 size paper were included in the review investigation, as requested by the Community industry. These products are clearly PPCs as defined in the product description of the proceeding (2). The only reason for their exclusion from the original measures was that at the time of the original investigation segments (3) 5 and 6 were not imported from Japan and segment 6 was not produced by the Community industry. In its supplementary request for a review, Cecom submitted sufficient evidence that segment 5 PPCs had since been imported from Japan at dumped prices and were causing injury to the complainant Community industry, producing in the adjacent segments 4 and 6, thus warranting the inclusion of PPCs with a capacity of over 75 copies per minute of A4 size paper within the scope of the review investigation. This inclusion was commented on by several exporters and importers. They contested the view that the product scope of an Article 15 review can be as large as the product definition of the proceeding and considered that such a review should be limited to the product types covered by the measures. However, the design, production and marketing of particular product types often evolves over time, with new types still being essentially the same product. For PPC's, for instance, the market trend has been towards more productive, larger and faster types of PPCs, the essential characteristics of which are, however, still the same. If the Commission were to be prevented from investigating new types of the same product in an Article 15 review, simply because those types had not yet been produced at the time of the original investigation, a new proceeding would have to be opened. Conducting two separate proceedings on the same product originating from the same country would be illogical, contrary to the system envisaged by Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, and conducive to incongruous results. In the case of PPCs from Japan, the review of the existing measures pursuant to Article 15 was opened and conducted in accordance with Article 14 as well, based on the view that Article 15 should, and indeed can only, be read in conjunction with Article 14. Reviews of existing measures under these provisions may lead to the amendment of those measures. If, following a review, existing measures could not be amended to include within the scope of those measures new types of the same product, the effectiveness of those measures would be impaired. Several exporters also commented that the Commission had not re-consulted the Advisory Committee during the time between Cecom's supplement to its review request and the initiation of the review. However, the proceeding on imports of PPC's from Japan covers all types of PPC's, irrespective of their copy speed, and the Advisory Committee was duly consulted on the basic Commission proposal to initiate an Article 15 review in respect of this proceeding. The precise parameters of the investigation were not, at that time, a matter of discussion, but were clearly indicated in the notice of initiation, and the inclusion of PPCs over 75 copies per minute was subsequently discussed in the Advisory Committee on several occasions before any conclusions on the scope of possible measures were drawn. Private parties have their own extensive procedural rights, and all comments made by them in the course of the investigation on the types of product covered by the investigation and by possible measures were carefully considered before any conclusions were drawn. 3. Like product (16) With respect to the question whether the PPCs sold by the Japanese producers and exporters concerned on the Japanese market and in the Community constitute a like product with the PPCs sold in the Community by the Community industry, it was established in the course of the review investigation that the basic technical characteristics (as described in recitals 11 and 12) of all PPCs investigated were identical or closely resembled one another within the meaning of Article 2 (12) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. Furthermore, in terms of their application, at least - but not necessarily alone - PPCs in adjoining segments compete with each other for the same users and should be considered like products. (17) Japanese segment 5 PPCs, which were not produced by the Community industry during the investigation period, were, on the above analysis, considered to be like products to the segment 4 and segment 6 models which the Community industry did produce. One exporter in particular argued that there was no competition between Japanese segment 5 PPCs and the segment 4 and segment 6 PPCs produced by the Community industry, based notably on alleged differences in copy speed, copy volume and usage. However, it was found in the course of the investigation that the actual monthly copy volumes of segment 4 PPCs of the Community industry were frequently similar to those of Japanese segment 5 PPCs. Also, the copy speed of the latter was often not much higher in complex applications such as duplex copying than that of the segment 4 PPCs of the Community industry. As for usage, no fundamental difference was observed between segment 4 models of the Community industry and Japanese segment 5 models. With respect to the Community industry's segment 6 PPCs, it may be true that those PPCs are more economical than Japanese segment 5 PPCs when used in central reproduction departments with high copy volumes. But no convincing evidence was supplied that Japanese segment 5 PPCs cannot also be used, even though perhaps less efficiently, for processing of high copy volumes, whether centralized in a reproduction department or decentralized in office corridors. Certainly for customers with a copy volume in between high and very high, there is thus a real choice between a segment 5 and a segment 6 PPC. Furthermore, evidence was submitted by another Japanese exporters that in fact fierce competition existed, especially in the context of large bids and tenders, between a 'centralized` hardware package, including segment 6 PPCs, offered by the Community industry to fulfil the client's copying needs and a 'de-package`, including segment 5 and segment 4 PPCs, offered by Japanese companies to fulfil exactly the same copying needs. In this sense, competition between PPCs even extends beyond adjoining segments. On the whole, therefore, the strong growth in sales of segment 5 PPCs has been at least partly at the expense of sales of segment 4 and segment 6 PPCs, in the sense that in the absence of segment 5 models, customers with the need for such a significant copy volume could not normally have foregone buying a PPC and would have had to buy either a segment 4 or a segment 6 model. As for Japanese segment 6 PPCs, one Japanese company had already started exporting a segment 6 model from Japan to the Community and had commenced marketing it here during the investigation period of the review. These imports competed, on the above analysis, with the Community industry's PPCs in segments 6 and 4. (18) Japanese personal copiers, the smallest PPCs on the market, which were not produced by the Community industry in the investigation period, should be considered a like product to the segment 1 PPCs produced by the Community industry. These two segments overlap in terms of copy speed, the remaining difference between them merely being that segment 1 PPCs tend to have more features, for example the possibility for reduction and enlargement, and sometimes a larger copy volume capacity. When technical differences are so small, customer choice depends heavily on pricing. C. COMMUNITY INDUSTRY 1. Introduction (19) The question whether a Community industry existed and, if so, which producers were part thereof, was important in this review for two reasons: Procedurally, interested parties requesting a review under Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 must, pursuant to paragraph 3 of that Article, show that the expiry of the measures would lead again to injury or threat of injury to a Community industry. Substantively, the likelihood of recurrence of injury of threat thereof must, in the review investigation, be assessed in relation to the Community industry, as defined in Article 4 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. Some exporters and importers questioned whether the complainant requesting the review represented Community producers whose collective output of PPCs constituted a major proportion of the total Community production of PPCs, within the meaning of Article 4 (5), and whether therefore the injury assessment should be limited to those producers. 2. The Community industry in the original investigation (20) When the proceeding on PPCs was launched in August 1985, the Community industry consisted of 5 producers: Develop Dr Eisbein GmbH, Germany, Océ Nederland BV, the Netherlands, Ing. C. Olivetti & C. SpA, Italy, Rank Xerox Ltd, United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and Tetras SA, France. Together they constituted Cecom. In May 1986, a majority of the shares in Develop was acquired by one of the Japanese exporters, and Develop was excluded from the Community industry for the purpose of the injury determination of the original investigation. Japanese subsidiary companies producing photocopiers in the Community were also excluded (1). In November 1986, another Japanese exporter took a majority share in Tetras, which did not prevent Tetras from remaining part of the Community industry (2). Since then, however, Tetras has stopped producing or selling PPCs. The decision in the original investigation to accept Rank Xerox, Océ and Olivetti as part of the Community industry was reached notwithstanding the fact that all three of them imported part of their range of PPC models from Japan. In addition, Rank Xerox had a 50 % share holding in one of the Japanese exporters, and had a relatively low percentage of EC added value for its production of small PPCs in the United Kingdom. The Council's conclusions on Community industry in the original investigation, both in respect of retaining the complaining companies as part of the Community industry and of excluding Japanese subsidiaries producing in the Community from the Community industry, were upheld by the European Court of Justice (3). In doing so, the Court emphasized that the Community authorities exercise a margin of appreciation in this respect, on a case-by-case basis, by reference to all the relevant facts. 3. The Community industry in the review investigation (21) The request for the review was submitted on behalf of the three remaining members of Cecom, Rank Xerox, Océ and Olivetti. (22) Rank Xerox's claim to be part of the Community industry has strengthened since the original investigation. It neither imported nor sold PPCs from Japan in the Community during the investigation period of the review. It significantly increased the percentage of Community added value for its production of small PPCs in the United Kingdom. Its company-wide Community added value, including production of high-speed PPCs in France, was also substantially higher than in the original investigation, at such a level that its Community origin is beyond any doubt. Rank Xerox is therefore still to be regarded as part of the Community industry. (23) Following the original investigation, Océ has maintained a significant level of production in the higher speed segments, with a very high Community added value, guaranteeing Community origin. But it did not succeed in extending its own-manufactured product range into the lower speed segments, where it continues to be supplied on the basis of an OEM (original equipment manufacturing) arrangement with a Japanese company. These OEM PPCs represent a minor, although not insignificant, part of Océ's PPC turnover in the Community. However, it was observed during the review investigation that it is now quite common for producers, including producers in Japan, to buy part of the extensive model range required by consumers from other producers. In addition, during the investigation period of the review the great majority of Océ's PPCs was no longer supplied from Japan, but from a third country not subject to the review (the correct origin of which was confirmed). Thus, the number of PPCs which Océ imports from Japan has sharply decreased since the original investigation. Océ could, therefore, as in the original investigation, be regarded as part of the Community industry. (24) In 1987, Olivetti shifted its entire PPC production to a newly-created joint venture with Canon, Olivetti-Canon Industriale (OCI), established at the old Olivetti premises in Ivrea, Italy. In this joint venture Olivetti holds half of the shares plus one. Olivetti's position as a member of Cecom was clarified by a letter from OCI of 15 October 1992, in which it was confirmed that OCI, by a decision of its Board of Directors of 22 June 1992, delegated to Olivetti the right to represent OCI for the purpose of this anti-dumping proceeding. OCI produces PPCs in segment 1, which are sold through the Olivetti and Canan sales channels. The Community added value of these PPCs is sufficient to ensure Community origin. The review investigation showed that OCI, rather than Olivetti, should be considered as a 'producer` of PPCs within the meaning of Article 4 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. OCI is an independent legal entity in charge of the actual manufacturing of PPCs. Olivetti is a major, but not dominant, shareholder in this company. It is one of OCI's two sales outlets, and is its legal representative for the purpose of the review. But Olivetti does not itself 'produce` PPCs. It was considered that there was no need to exclude OCI from the Community industry. It is true that 50 % of the shares minus one in OCI are owned by Canon, one of the companies exporting the PPCs from Japan that were investigated in the review. But there was no reason to believe that OCI, which is jointly controlled by Canon and Olivetti, which claimed the protection offered by Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 against imports of PPCs from Japan, which did not import any PPCs from Japan, and which granted full cooperation to the review investigation , behaved in a way that was different from that of Rank Xerox or Océ, or in any way that would be liable to render the findings of the investigation incorrect or unreliable. It was, however, necessary to limit the injury determination for OCI to the production for and sales made through the Olivetti sales channel. This was because Canon did not provide the information necessary to permit the Commission to investigate OCI's sales through the Canon sales channel, and because sales information from Canon, one of the exporters of PPCs from Japan, could in any case not be taken into account in this review for the purpose of determining injury to the Community industry. As for Olivetti, although the majority of the PPCs it sold in the Community in the investigation period were sourced from Canon, in accordance with the normal commercial strategy of offering a complete range of models, these PPCs did not originate in Japan. In any case, sales transactions between OCI and Olivetti were ignored as being transfers between related parties and data on cost of production and sales of OCI-produced PPCs by Olivetti to unrelated customers were established through verifications. (25) Following the introduction of definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of PPCs from Japan in 1987, almost all Japanese exporters established or expanded production facilities in the Community (in France, the United Kingdom and Germany). As opposed to OCI, all of these production facilities in the Community are 100 % or majority owned by exporters of PPCs from Japan, and none of them joined the review request. It was considered that, as the review concerned imports from Japan, these production facilities, the commercial behaviour of which was determined by the parent companies in Japan under investigation and which did not support the review request, had to be excluded from the Community industry, as their behaviour was shown to be different from that of producers in the Community that were not related to Japanese exporters. 4. Conclusion on the Community industry (26) In conclusion, for the purpose of this review, the Community industry consisted of Océ, OCI and Rank Xerox. The output of these Community producers, limited for OCI to the portion produced for and sold through Olivetti, represented the near totality of Community production of the like product, given that the production facilities majority-owned by Japanese exporters had, for the purpose of this review, to be excluded from Community industry. This exclusion entailed that their PPC production in the Community, whether or not having sufficient Community added value to be of Community origin, did not qualify as Community production, nor did they qualify as Community producers, within the meaning of Article 4 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, for the purpose of this review. Community production was the production of the Community industry and of other producers in the Community that were not excluded, but that chose not to support the review. The only other possible Community producer in this review was Kodak, with a factory in Germany. Although Kodak supplied information in response to the Commission's questionnaire, it did not participate in the investigation as part of the Community industry, and it is uncertain whether its limited PPC operations in the Community would qualify as production. The volume of PPCs involved was, in any case, quite small. D. THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THE COMMUNITY MARKET 1. Introduction (27) In order to establish whether the expiry of the measures in force would lead again to dumping and injury or threat of injury, it was first necessary to examine the present economic situation of the Community industry. This analysis consists of three parts. The first part briefly recollects the economic situation of the Community industry at the time of the original investigation. In a second part, developments in that situation between 1988 and the end of the investigation period are analysed in detail. Finally, those recent developments are compared with the situation at the time of the original investigation and a conclusion is drawn on the state of the present economic situation of the Community industry. 2. Situation of the Community industry at the time of the original investigation (28) In the original investigation period (1 January to 31 July 1985), the Community market share of the Community industry for its own-manufactured PPCs had dropped from 21 % in 1981 to 11,2 %. Price undercutting in the form of the sale of more highy-featured models imported from Japan at prices comparable to or below those of lesser-featured Community industry models was found. Price depression was taking place. The PPC hardware profitability of the Community industry had decreased from 8 % net profit before tax in 1983 to 4 % in the investigation period, while the target profit for the Community industry had been determined at 12 %. Taking these elements into account, the Council considered that material injury to the Community industry existed. 3. Current situation of the Community industry Introduction (29) The indicators for the Community industry analysed below relate to the period from 1988 to the end of the investigation period of the review (1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992). They pertain to the own-manufactured PPCs of the Community industry. Refurbishing (the re-working of existing models taken back from the field with a view to placing them again on the market) was included in the data. Data for OCI were limited to production for and sales via Olivetti. Production, production capacity, utilization of capacity, stocks (30) Production of the Community industry decreased by 16 % from 226 480 units in 1988 to 190 375 units in the investigation period. Over the same period, the production capacity of the Community industry decreased by 29 %. As a result of this, capacity utilization improved 13 % to a level of 81 % in the investigation period, based on one work shift of eight hours. Stocks increased by 7 %. Employment, investments, R& D expenses (31) The number of manufacturing personnel employed by the Community industry increased by 13 %, reflecting a gradual shift to the manufacturing of larger and more complex PPCs and environmental concerns resulting in an increasing level of activity in refurbishing existing models, a procedure which is relatively labour-intensive, The overall level of employment increased by 4 %, to a total of 16 549 people in the investigation period. Over the same period, R& D expenses increased from 5,3 % of turnover to 5,4 % of turnover. Sales volume and market share (32) The number of placements made by the Community industry decreased 1 % from 141 477 units to 140 186 units, in a Community market which expanded by 24 %. The market share of the Community industry consequently decreased by a fifth, from 15,4 to 12,4 %, measured in units. Weighting the number of units placed on the market by their copy volume, which takes account of differences between small and large PPCs, the market share of the Community industry was still 29 % in the investigation period, but down by a sixth from 34,4 % in 1988. Particularly notable was the decrease in the Community market share of the Community industry for medium-large PPCs, in which it used to have a strong market position and which formed a major source of profits. In segment 4, for instance, the market share of the Community industry decreased from 64,4 % in 1988 to 42,1 % in the investigation period, a dramatic drop of a third. Price development (33) The measurement of PPC price developments in the Community over time is to some extent necessarily speculative, due to the lack of information on actual sales prices (as opposed to list prices) for the years prior to the investigation period, the rapid succession of PPC models, with changes in features, and the need to take account of developments in production costs, inflation and exchange rates. What can be observed, however, is that between 1988 and the investigation period, there were a number of instances where Japanese companies introduced new models with more features, or more advanced features, at list prices below those of the old models. In other cases, list prices were kept stable for several years, despite inflation and appreciation of the yen. As for the Community industry, one company registered decreases in its list prices of between 21 and 29 % for the period between 1988 and the investigation period, and another decreases in revenues for cost per copy contracts of 24 %, as adjusted for inflation. The third Community producer showed a mixture of list price decreases and increases, with the decreases centred more on lower segment models. All in all, therefore, there appears to have been a downward price spiral, in which most if not all companies participated, leading to price despression. Profitability (34) This price depression is reflected in the development of the profitability of the Community industry. While Community industry's turnover of own-manufactured PPCs increased by 3 % from 1988 to the investigation period, its return on those sales decreased by 76 %, from a weighted average level of 11,1 % in 1988 to 2,7 % in the investigation period. The profitability of the entire photocopier business of the Community industry, including service, consumables, spare parts, and financing, decreased by 42 % from a weighted average level of 11,1 % in 1988 to a level of 6,4 % in the investigation period. These figures demonstrate that, starting from the same level of profitability in 1988, sales of own-manufactured PPC hardware have become much less profitable than the accompanying sales of maintenance contracts, financing contracts, paper, toner, etc. This suggests that price competition on sales of PPC hardware has become especially fierce. Some exporters argued that the profitability of the Community industry should be evaluated on the basis of their overall photocopier business, and not just on sales of PPCs. Several observations should be made in this respect. First, the other elements involved in the overall photocopier business, such as the servicing, consumables, spare parts and financing elements mentioned above, are not the subject of this investigation. Secondly, the profit figures used for normal value are based on sales of PPCs only, and might have been higher, leading to a finding of more dumping, had they been based on the overall photocopier business. Indeed, in the original investigation, several exporters insisted that the Commission should base profitability for normal value on sales of PPC hardware only. The Commission then adopted this approach at their request, and, with a view to consistency, applied it also for the injury determination. The same approach was duly maintained in the review investigation. Finally, if the Community industry were not allowed to expect a reasonable return on the investment it has made to produce PPCs, it would have no incentive to continue manufacturing. Instead, the Community producers would probably become OEM distributors, merely selling and servicing PPCs produced by Japanese companies. It was therefore considered that a reasonable return should be available on the manufacture and sale of PPCs as such. Some exporters and improters also argued that the profitability of the Community industry had improved after the end of the investigation period to such an extent that the Community industry was no longer in a precarious situation. Events after the end of the investigation period are not normally taken into account, as the investigation would otherwise never end. However, given the unusual length of the investigation, this particular claim was, exceptionally, checked. It was found that while the overall profitability of the Community industry had improved somewhat, in line with the general improvement in the economy in the Community, profitability on sales of PPCs continued to lag far behind. The findings for the investigation period therefore still provided a reliable basis for the conclusion drawn below. 4. Conclusion on the current situation of the Community industry (35) Several key indicators of the economic performance of the Community industry deteriorated significantly from 1988 to the end of the investigation period, such as production (down 16 %), market share (down from 15,4 to 12,4 %), and PPC hardware profitability (down from 11,1 to 2,7 %). Comparing the injury data of the original investigation period with those of the review investigation period, it was observed, first, that the size of the Community market expanded over this period by 75 % from 53 913 units placed per month (in 10 Member States) to 94 286 units placed per month (in 12 Member States). In comparison with this market expansion, the sales in the Community of Community industry's ownmanufactured PPCs increased by 94 %, from 6 016 units per month to 11 682 units per month. The market share in the Community of the Community industry for its ownmanufactured PPCs consequently increased from 11,2 to 12,4 %, measured in units. However, this gain in market share was won at the expense of a reduction in profits, down from 4 % net profit before tax on PPC hardware in the original investigation period to 2,7 % in the review investigation period. In this capital-intensive industry which is currently developing major new successor products to PPCs such as digital copiers and multi-purpose office machines, both reasonable profits and significant market shares are important to ensure that the necessary investments in R& D and production facilities can be made in order to remain viable in the medium term. Comparing the original investigation period, when the Council determined that material injury existed, with the investigation period of the review, it could not, on the whole, be said that the Community industry had come to be in a better position. E. THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE EXPORTERS CONCERNED 1. Introduction (36) It was also necessary to examine the behaviour of the exporters concerned. In this respect, one exporter argued that for the purpose of determining whether the expiry of the measures in force would lead again to dumping and injury or threat of injury, its allegedly small and not well-known exports should not be cumulated with those of the other exporters. It must be observed, however, that, in principle, anti-dumping proceedings apply to imports from countries and not to individual exporters. Also, the impact of the dumped imports from the exporters concerned on the Community industry should be assessed globally, as every sale lost by Community industry to dumped imports hurts Community industry equally, whether it was lost to a small exporter or a large one. This particular exporter, whose sales to Community customers in any case represent as much as around 10 % of total Community sales of Japanese-origin PPCs, would thus be unfairly favoured if it were treated differently from the other Japanese exporters. 2. Volume of imports from Japan (37) The situation was found to be as follows: In absolute terms Between 1988 and the investigation period, the volume of imports from Japan decreased 16 %, from 351 970 units to 294 195 units per year. Relative to consumption During the same period, the total number of placements of PPCs in the Community per year is estimated to have increased by 24 % from 919 580 units to 1 137 910 units. The market share of imports from Japan thus decreased from 38,3 % in 1988 to 25,9 % in the investigation period. Relative to total production in the Community Between 1988 and the investigation period, total production in the Community increased 30 % from 640 263 units to 834 094 units per year, including Japanese production facilities in the Community. Imports from Japan thus represented 55 % of total production in the Community in 1988, and 35,3 % in the investigation period. Relative to the production of the Community industry The production of the Community industry decreased by 16 % from 226 480 units in 1988 to 190 375 units in the investigation period. Imports from Japan thus represented 155,4 % of production of the Community industry in 1988, and 154,5 % in the investigation period. Conclusion on volume of imports (38) The introduction of the definitive anti-dumping duty in February 1987 was followed by a substantial decrease in the volume of imports from Japan. This trend has become even stronger recently, in line with the appreciation of the yen. At the same time, Japanese exporters have significantly increased production in the Community, up by 56 % from 413 783 units in 1988 to 643 719 units per year in the investigation period. They have also increased imports into the Community from factories established in third countries, up by 37,7 % from 106 012 units in 1988 to 145 978 units per year in the investigation period. Nevertheless, the volume of imports from Japan during the investigation period still amounted to almost 300 000 units per year, representing 26 % of the Community market, measured in units, and more than one and a half times the production volume in units of the Community industry. It also appeared that over time a larger part of the imports from Japan has come to consist of medium-large to large PPCs, putting extra pressure on the traditionally strong market position of the Community industry for such PPCs. On the whole, therefore, imports from Japan in the investigation period were still capable of having a very significant effect on Community industry, depending in particular on the price level at which they were sold. 3. Prices of imports from Japan Methodology to examine price undercutting (39) The extent to which the weighted average sales prices of imports from Japan in the investigation period in the Community market undercut the weighted average sales prices of the Community industry during the investigation period was examined for the German, Franch, Italian and United Kingdom markets, which were considered representative for the Community market as a whole, as they represented the large majority of sales on the Community market, both by the Community industry and imported from Japan. As opposed to Japanese subsidiaries in the Community, who placed PPCs mainly with dealers for outright sale, the Community industry placed PPCs mainly with end-users, on leases, cost-per-copy contracts and rentals. To permit a fair price comparison, the Commission used only the outright sales and leases of the Community industry. To 'unbundle` the latter type of contracts into a hardware element to be used for the price comparison, setting aside the financial element, companies' normal internal accounting rules, based on generally accepted accounting practices, were used. The weighted average PPC hardware price thus calculated for each model was then compared with the corresponding weighted average Japanese outright sales prices. Pure rentals, i.e. contracts that do not qualify as sales under normal accounting rules, were excluded from the comparison. So were cost-per-copy contracts, wheter or not qualifying as sales-type contracts, because of the difficulty of objectively 'unbundling` them. As for the calculation of sales prices, these were net of directly linked discounts and rebates. In this respect, trade-in discounts were not regarded as a discount on the sale of the new machine, in the same way as for the dumping calculation. Only newly-manufactured models were compared, as the use of re-furbished or remanufactured models on one side of the equation might have distorted the price comparisons. Given the technical complexity of comparing the models of the Community industry with those of Japanese exporters, price undercutting was examined on the basis of a representative sample of seven own-manufactured models of the Community industry, out of a total of 30. These models were selected to represent a broad range of PPC models, covering those product segments where the Community industry sold almost all of its own-manufactured models, i.e segments 1 to 4. Together these models amounted to around 30 % of the Community industry's PPC turnover in the Community in the investigation period, with each of them having a significant volume of sales. The total number of units sold of the seven Community industry models in the four Member States concerned was around 15 000, and the distribution between outright sales and leases roughly 50/50. For each of these representative Community industry models a comparable imported model of each Japanese exporter was selected whenever available. Almost all of these models were also sold in substantial quantities. As for the few imported models that were sold only in small quantities, their prices were not observed to be significantly out of line with other, more frequently sold models. In any case, when calculating the weighted average undercutting margin for each exporter, small quantities carried little weight. Two product segments not covered in the undercutting exercise were personal copiers, the smallest PPCs, and segment 6, the largest PPCs. Personal copiers competed with the segment 1 PPCs of the Community industry, just as Japanese segment 5 PPCs competed with the Community industry segment 6 models. However, in order to arrive at the most reliable price comparisons, with the smallest adjustments for differences in technical characteristics, Japanese segment 1 models were compared with the Community industry segment 1 models, and Japanese segment 5 models were compared with the Community industry segment 4 models. This does not mean that Japanese personal copiers were not undercutting the Community industry's segment models or that Japanese segment 5 models were not undercutting the Community industry's segment 6 models, as properly adjusted for differences in technical characteristics. It merely means that it was not considered necessary to include such comparisons in the undercutting exercise, as price comparisons based on more similar product segments, covering by far the largest part of Community production, were available. (40) Where necessary, appropriate adjustments were made both for differences in technical characteristics and for differences in trade levels. Regarding adjustments for technical differences, the number of criteria used was substantial and differed according to product segment. The adjustments were determined by the Commission on the basis of input from both the Community industry and exporters. In general, adjustments were made for the presence or absence of features, not for any alleged differences in quality for the same features. Such differences were considered too subjective and difficult to estimate to permit reliable quantification. The value of features was, in principle, calculated as the ratio between the list price of the feature concerned and the list price of the basic model without that feature, as determined for a number of other models in the same product segment. The value of minor features was sometimes estimated as a percentage of the value of more important comparable features. The value of options, which often had to be added to Japanese models to make them comparable to the models of the Community industry, was calculated as the ratio of their list price to that of the basic Japanese mdoel. The resulting percentage was then added to the actual sales price of the basic model, based on the assumption that the percentage discount on the list price of the option was similar to the percentage discount on the basic model. Following claims by exporters, the Commission examined whether an adjustment should be made for the generally higher weight of the Community industry models in comparison with Japanese models, especially in the higher copy speed range. In this respect, it was considered that greater weight in itself does not have any value in the eyes of consumers. If anything, the opposite was more likely to be true. More importantly, as a measure for greater productivity or durability, the weight criterion was found to be inaccurate, as the actual and target monthly copy volumes of the Japanese models used in the sample, and their actual and target operational life, were in fact not significantly different from those of the Community industry models in the sample, both in absolute terms and relative to copy speed. With respect to durability, it was also found that lease periods with customers were generally comparable in length, meaning that customers write off PPCs after the same length of time, whether it concerns a Japanese model or an Community industry model, Japanese models were also frequently sold second hand. Furthermore, the capacity of a model to be re-manufactured or re-furbished and then sold again does not affect its operational value in the eyes of the first-time user. No adjustment for weight or alleged differences in productivity/durability was therefore granted. Some exporters also argued that an adjustment should be made for the allegedly higher quality and greater length of the warranty provided by Rank Xerox and Océ. It was found, however, that those warranties are provided only to customers that conclude a maintenance contract, and are financed from the proceeds thereof. The Community industry's warranties without maintenance contracts were comparable to those of the Japanese exporters. (41) Regarding levels of trade, sales were compared at the same level of trade whenever such sales were made in sufficient quantities. In this respect, Olivetti sales to end-users and Océ sales to dealers had been made in insufficient quantities and were disregarded. Sales of certain models by Rank Xerox to dealers in certain Member States were also disregarded as being too small in volume. Almost all Japanese companies sold in sufficient quantities at dealer level but only some at end-user level. Where the Community industry end-user sales had to be compared with Japanese dealer sales, the former were brought to the dealer level. This adjustment was calculated based on the actual difference in price between the two levels of Rank Xerox (for models sold in sufficient quantities), the sales structure of which was considered comparable to Océ for this purpose. Japanese sales at distributor level were also adjusted to bring them to dealer level, based on price differences of Japanese companies between these two levels. All brand sales were thus compared at dealer level, or at end-user level if sufficient volumes had been sold by both sides. As for Japanese sales to OEM importers, these were compared as adjusted to cif Community frontier level, customs and anti-dumping duties and customs clearance charges added, with prices of the Community industry adjusted from end-user or dealer level to ex-level. For this latter purpose, the percentage reduction in cost for selling ex factory, based on the Community industry's own cost structure, was deducted from their actual sales prices. Results (42) On this basis, weighted average undercutting margin per exporter, for all of its imported models in the sample together, ranged from 7 to 36 %. The weighted average degree of undercutting of all exporters together was 26 %. The weighted average degree of undercutting for segments 4 and 5 was twice that for segments 1 to 3 (38 % compared to 19 %). The weighted average degree of undercutting was higher in Germany and the United Kingdom than in France and Italy, but it was high in the latter two Member States as well. These figures show that, despite the existence of the anti-dumping measures in force, Japanese exporters were still selling their PPCs on the Community market at prices significantly below those of the Community industry. Underselling (43) The same methodology as described above for undercutting was used to examine the price increase necessary at the net, free-at-Community frontier, before duty level to raise the actual sales prices of the imported models in the sample to a level at which the Community industry would be able to sell at a profit permitting a reasonable return on investment. The weighted average actual sales prices of each exporter as calculated in the examination of undercutting were set against the target prices of the models of the Community industry. The absolute amounts by which they fell short of those target prices were then transformed, on a weighted average basis for each exporter, into the underselling margin at the net, free-at-Community frontier, before duty level. For this purpose, in order to bring sales by related importers to first independent buyers in the Community back to the net, free-at-Community frontier, before duty level, the existing anti-dumping and customs duties were deducted. For PPCs over 75 copies per minute, no anti-dumping duty was in force and no such deduction was made. On this basis, the weighted average underselling margin for each exporter ranged from 44 to 141 %. The weighted average degree of underselling of all exporters together at this level was 113 %. (44) The target profit margin for the Community industry used in this examination was calculated before tax as a percentage of actual turnover in the investigation period sufficient to deliver a return on equity before tax of 18 %, which was considered reasonable for publicly-quoted companies with a respectable financial status in this business sector. This 18 % consisted of a market interest rate of 8 % during the investigation period of the review, a premium of 4 % required to compensate shareholders for the risks incurred in investing, and an average tax rate applicable to the Community industry of 35 %. The turnover and assets used for this calculation covered the entire copier business of the Community industry, as it was not possible to reliably identify separately the assets used for PPC hardware sales. It was considered, in any case, that the return on equity for the PPC hardware part of the copier business should not be lower than for the other parts. The Community industry's sales outside the Community, but produced in the Community, were included in the turnover used. The resulting target return on sales was 9,4 % on a weighted average basis for the Community industry as a whole. (45) Given that the weighted average actual profit before tax of the Community industry on PPC hardware was 2,7 % in the investigation period, sales prices of the Community industry models in the sample were increased by an extra 6,7 % profit on turnover. This method, which is based on the weighted average actual profit of all Community industry own-manufactured models together rather than the actual profit or loss achieved on just the models in the sample, takes account of the higher profit rates achieved by the Community industry on segment 6 models, which were not included in the comparison table. For this reason, this method was preferred over the more common method of adding a 9,4 % profit margin on turnover to the cost of production of each model in the comparison table. 4. Conclusion (46) Following the introduction of the original anti-dumping measures, PPC imports from Japan showed a significant fall in volume. The remaining volume of these imports was, however, still quite significant. The imports from Japan also showed a shift toward larger PPCs. The degree of undercutting found in the Community market for Japanese imports was high all around, and especially high for the larger PPCs. Given this strong price pressure exerted by substantial import volumes from Japan, it was considered necessary to examine whether dumping was occurring which contributed to the situation of the Community industry described above and whether the expiry of the anti-dumping measures in force would lead to a recurrence of dumping and injury. F. RECURRENCE OF DUMPING 1. General (47) Dumping calculations, both for normal value and export price, were based on verified outright sales of PPCs only. Leases, rentals and cost-per-copy contracts were excluded in order to facilitate the calculations and render them more reliable. Since these types of contracts represented only a small percentage of total transactions for the Japanese companies, both in the Community and Japan, it was assumed that the results would not be significantly affected. (48) Dumping margins were initially established separately for brand sales and OEM sales and combined to a single weighted average dumping margin for each exporter only in the last stage of the calculation. OEM sales, whether on the domestic market or for export to the Community, could generally be distinguished from brand sales by several factors: significantly lower sales, advertising, service and other costs were incurred for OEM sales than for brand sales; the OEM PPCs were re-sold to final customers under a brand name not owned by the exporter; and the relationship between the producer and the OEM purchaser was at arm's length. (49) The OEM importer Afga Gevaert requested to have its own dumping margin and duty, arguing that there was less dumping on its imports from Japan, that it had not contributed to the dumping, and that it deserved special treatment because of the allegedly large contribution it made to the design and development of the PPCs it purchased in Japan. It was established in the investigation that the imports of Agfa Gevaert were dumped, albeit less so than the brand sales of its Japanese suppliers. As for the contribution of Agfa Gevaert to the PPCs it purchased from Japan, the value added was limited and focused on the outside appearance of the PPC and the lay-out and software of its control panel, rather than on the functioning of the PPC inside. It was clear, therefore, that Agfa Gevaert could not be considered the producer of its Japanese-sourced PPCs, but that it was an OEM importer. It is not possible under the legal framework established by Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 to impose separate duties on individual importers, whether OEM or brand-sale, as opposed to exporters. Separate duties for importers could easily lead to selective dumping by the exporters concerned. Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 stipulates that an anti-dumping duty may be applied to any dumped 'product` whose release for free circulation in the Community causes injury, where a product shall be considered to have been dumped of its 'export price` to the Community is less than the normal value of the like product. For the calculation of this export price, the exports to all Community importers of all different types of the product concerned should be cumulated, in accordance with Article 2 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. Article 13 (2) of that Regulation confirms that regulations imposing anti-dumping duties shall indicate the product covered, the country of origin or export and, if practicable, the name of the supplier. No provision is made for indicating the name of the importer. (50) So-called trade-in discounts were considered as representing the value of the traded-in PPC or, when such PPCs were destroyed, the value of preventing a second-hand market from overtaking sales of newly produced PPCs. Not being considered true discounts, they were not deducted from the sales price of the new machine, either for normal value or for export price. Such expenses were considered part of selling, general and administrative (SGA) costs. The fact that these expenses could be linked by some exporters to the sale of new PPCs is not surprising, since the old PPC is only traded in when a new one is purchased. This does not, however, mean that the money paid by the supplier for the traded-in PPC is a discount on the sale of the new PPC. Also, the fact that some exporters treated these expenses as deductions from gross turnover in their accounting records is not determinative for the legal interpretation of the concept of a discount referred to in Article 2 (3) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. The same approach was followed in respect of the practice of paying off the remaining lease term of a PPC in the field in order to sell a new one, which is a scheme similar to a trade-in discount. The methodology was the same as that used in the original investigation, which has been accepted by the European Court of Justice (1). (51) Ordinary financial expenses were taken into account as a cost both for normal value and for export prices. Offsetting financial revenue resulting from the normal operation of the business was accepted, up to the level where it completely cancelled out the financial expenses. The argument of some exporters that financial revenues should be allowed to further offset other SGA costs was not accepted, as an excess of financial income should not be allowed to eliminate SGA expenses that were actually incurred. Credit granted by suppliers was, in accordance with normal Commission practice, not regarded as an offsetting financial revenue, but as a potential cost not incurred, for which no allowance can be made. Extraordinary income and expenses were disregarded in all cases. (52) In addition, in respect of both normal value and export price, the expenses and revenue involved in PPC service centres were included in certain cases in the calculation of SGA percentages applicable to sales of PPCs, namely when it was established in the course of verification that these centres provided certain benefits without charge to buyers of PPCs, for instance by giving technical training to dealers or providing free spare parts, the costs of which could not be identified separately. Since these centres were also involved in the conclusion and operation of maintenance contracts, the turnover produced thereby was, in those cases, also included. 2. Normal value Links between legally separate companies (53) Such links were the subject of discussion in two respects. First, the question arose as to whether two of the exporters did not, in reality, form a single economic entity. One of these two companies (company A) is majority-owned by the other (company B) and is included in the latter's consolidated accounts, even though it is a legal entity in its own right, listed separately on the stock exchange. Company A assembles, on the basis of a sub-contracting agreement, a large quantity of PPCs for company B. For this purpose, the latter supplies the results of its R& D, the technical designs, and a majority of the parts. Company B, which should be considered the producer of these PPCs, sells these and other PPCs both in Japan and for export to the Community. A joint selling company of companies A and B sells, in Japan, PPCs of company B's brand. However, company A also produces - partially different - PPCs for its own account, with some R& D of its own and with royalty payments to company B for the remainder. Company A sells these PPCs for export to the Community (but not in Japan), partly to OEM purchasers and partly under its own brand name, for which it has set up a distribution network of its own. In this respect, company A exercises the full functions of producer/exporter, and it is in this respect, therefore, that it should be considered a separate economic entity from company B, although it is clearly related. In the absence of domestic sales of own-manufactured PPCs, whether brand sales or OEM sales, normal value for company A was constructed, based partly on costs verified at the premises of company A, company B and their joint selling company, and partly on the weighted average cost and profit of other producers. (54) The above situation where two companies operate at the same horizontal level and exercises the same functions, even though one is majority-owned by and partly dependent on the other, should be distinguished from the situation where a division of production and sales activities is drawn within a group made up of legally distinct companies, with one company producing and the other company selling. Two companies operating such a vertical distribution of tasks, each incomplete in itself, do constitute a single economic entity, as confirmed by the European Court of Justice on many occasions. Thus, the Commission could not accept the claim made by certain exporters that the export prices and normal value used were not comparable within the meaning of Article 2 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. Both domestic and export prices were in fact compared ex warehouse of the producer, with domestic sales subsidiaries forming part of the economic entity 'producer`, as they fulfilled tasks which are normally the responsibility of an internal sales department of the producer. Sales by such domestic subsidiaries have thus been properly compared with the sales made by the producer's export department for export to the Community. Appropriate allowances for differences affecting price comparability were subsequently made in accordance with Articles 2 (9) and 1 (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. Selective normal value (55) Two exporters claimed that they operated a separate sales channel for sales to unrelated distributors, that these sales were at a different level of trade than their sales to other types of clients, and that this level of trade should be used to establish normal value for comparison with export prices, to the exclusion of their sales to other clients. The Commission investigated these claims. For both exporters it was found, based on a representative sample of models, that the prices of their individual transactions with the stated distributors overlapped to a considerable degree with the prices of individual transactions with other types of clients, whether dealers or end-users. With respect to quantities sold to the stated distributors, whether model-by-model or in total, there was also significant overlap with quantities sold to other types of clients, whether dealers or end-users. The claimed distributors of one exporter were, furthermore, found to sell partly to end-users, meaning that in this respect they were exercising the same functions as dealers. As for the other exporter, it reported its sales to the claimed distributors as taking place through the same sales channel as its sales to large end-users, implying a similar cost structure for both types of clients. Finally, for both exporters the total of sales to claimed unrelated distributors by volume was very small in relation to the volume of their domestic sales and less than 5 % of their export sales. Under these conditions, it was considered that the exporters had not demonstrated that the claimed sales channels of unrelated distributors were consistently distinguishable from sales to other types of clients in terms of costs, quantities, prices, and functions of buyer, and that the exporters had thus failed to prove why the claimed distributor channel should be used to the exclusion of other sales channels for the comparison with export prices. There was, furthermore, no reason to exclude sales to end-users, as requested by one of the above exporters, as the prices of individual transactions with end-users, especially large ones, overlapped to a great extent with the prices of individual transactions with dealers. Normal value for brand sales based on actual prices (56) In the investigation period, all but one of the exporters visited had a volume of domestic PPC sales which exceeded 5 % of their export sales to the Community. Normal value for this one exporter was constructed. For the other exporters, it was considered that their domestic PPC sales, taken as a whole, were sufficiently representative to serve as the basis for the determination of normal value. For those exporters, transactions covering at least 70 % of domestic PPC turnover were the subject of verification. Some transactions that were, at the request of exporters, not used for the calculations pertained to sales channels with a very small turnover or to sales made by very small related sales subsidiaries. For these exporters, domestic PPC models that were comparable with models exported to the Community were identified, adjustments being made where necessary and feasible for differences in technical characteristics to the domestic models. For a number of export models, closely resembling domestic models were not found. Normal value for those models was constructed. For each comparable domestic model, the volume of domestic sales was compared with the volume of export sales to the Community of the export model. Where domestic sales did not exceed 5 % of export sales in volume, those domestic sales were not considered representative for the model in question, and normal value for that model was constructed. (57) For each remaining comparable model, the number of units sold domestically at a profit was calculated, by comparing the net invoice value - after deduction of directly related rebates and discounts - of each transaction with the cost of production, calculated in the manner indicated further below. Where profitable sales exceeded 80 % in volume of total domestic sales of the model concerned, normal value was calculated as the weighted average sales price of all transactions, including those at a loss. Where profitable sales represented between 20 and 80 % in volume of total domestic sales of the model concerned, normal value was calculated as the weighted average sales price of profitable transactions only. Where profitable sales represented less than 20 % in volume of total domestic sales of the model concerned, normal value for that model was constructed, as it was then considered not to have been sold in the ordinary course of trade, within the meaning of Article 2 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. Constructed normal value for brand sales (58) Where, in accordance with the above methodology, normal value had to be constructed, the cost of manufacturing of the export models was calculated. Amounts for depreciation of moulds were based on normal Japanese accounting and tax practices, resulting in full depreciation over two years. In some cases where statements of manufacturing costs submitted by exporters were found to be significantly out of line with audited figures for cost of goods sold and stocks, corrections were made. (59) The reasonable amount for SGA expenses to be added to arrive at the full cost of production was, for all producers, based on their own cost structure, including sales subsidiaries, in accordance with the single economic entity concept. This includes the one producer which did not sell PPCs of its own brand domestically, as in that case the SGA costs were taken to be those which it incurred in selling, through its joint domestic sales subsidiary with another producer, PPCs of that other producer's brand. The same approach had been followed in the original investigation. This producer argued that if it had sold its own brand PPCs domestically, it would have sold them in small quantities only and in a more direct manner with fewer costs. However, this producer did have a domestic sales structure and there was no reason to assume, without any evidence, that it would not have sold its own brand PPCs through that structure. Furthermore, since the SGA was calculated as a percentage of turnover, the argument that a smaller quantity of sales, even through a different, simpler type of sales channel, would necessarily have led to a lower cost allocation, is flawed. Finally, the argument that this producer's own brand would be less well known is already taken into account by the fact that its domestic sales structure, on which SGA costs were based, incurred few advertising expenses for the PPCs of the other producer's brand. SGA expenses were calculated specifically for PPCs, and separately for each sales channel, whenever the available accounting informating permitted this. R& D expenses were normally based on those allocated, under internal company accounting rules, to the copier division as a whole (including digital and full colour copiers). Where a separate identification of the copier division was not possible, or where the company's allocation of R& D costs to the copier division did not take account of basic R& D that is not product-specific, the R& D costs for the company as a whole were taken, calculated as a percentage of the company's total cost of manufacturing for all products. The argument that R& D costs should be limited to those strictly incurred for PPCs was rejected: R& D expenses are general expenses, which have to be borne by the company on a current accounting basis and which must therefore be entered in the accounts for the financial year in which they are incurred on the turnover of similar products or, in the case of R& D that is not product-specific, on all products. Royalty income was allowed to offset R& D expenses. (60) In cases where exporters had a sufficient volume of profitable sales, the reasonable profit margin was the weighted average profit of their own sales, i. e. all sales if more than 80 % in volume was sold at a profit and profitable sales only if between 20 and 80 % in volume was sold at a profit. In other cases, the weighted average profit margin of all other producers with a sufficient volume of profitable sales was applied. Although some exporters criticized this approach as leading to high profit margins, this approach results directly from the ordinary course of trade test described in recital 57. Its correctness is confirmed by Article 2 (3) (b) (ii) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, which states clearly that the profit used in constructed normal value should be based on profitable sales. Normal value for OEM sales (61) The general methodology applied to establish normal value for OEM sales was identical to that outlined above for brand sales. In contrast to the situation at the time of the original investigation, several producers now made OEM sales in the domestic market. Where such sales represented more than 5 % in volume of OEM export sales to the Community, both overall and for each comparable model, normal value for OEM sales was established on the basis of prices actually paid, whenever such sales were made at a profit in sufficient volumes. In other cases, the OEM normal value was constructed, based on the producer's own cost and profit structure when possible, and on those of the OEM sales of other producers when necessary. In this latter case, given the availability of usable cost and profit data of other producers for domestic OEM sales of PPCs, the request of one exporter to use costs and profit incurred in its OEM sales of other products in the same business sector could not be granted, taking account of the provisions laid down in Article 2 (3) (b) (ii) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. (62) When normal values had to be constructed on the basis of the SGA expenses of other companies, R& D expenses were considered as part of the cost of manufacturing, so that each company's own R& D figures were used, together with the weighted average SGA expenses (excluding R& D) of other companies. This approach was considered to be more reliable than using other companies' R& D figures. 3. Export price General (63) Export prices were verified for arount 70 % of each exporter's total export sales to the Community. All sales to OEM importers were verified, either at the premises of the exporters or of their subsidiaries in the Community concerned with OEM sales. As for brand sales, which were sold almost exclusively via subsidiaries established in most of the Member States of the Community, it was deemed necessary to verify only a representative portion, based on the largest Member States. A correcting weighting factor was accordingly used in the final dumping calculation to re-establish the original ratio between brand sales and OEM sales. (64) Where models were sold in several different configurations, standard configurations were agreed with exporters, which were normally the most basic version of the model concerned. This standard configuration was then compared with domestic models, and, where necessary and feasible, appropriate adjustments were made to the normal value of the comparable domestic model. Status of importers (65) Three importers which had claimed to be unrelated to an exporter were found in fact to be related. The first case concerned an importer, in which one of the Japanese exporters had acquired a significant minority share in September 1991. This shareholding was substantial and appeared to allow the exporter to exert considerable influence over the importer, the exporter's acquisition being accompanied by a structural programme to increase cooperation between the two companies. During the remainder of the investigation period of the review, this cooperation, as verified at the premises of the importer, appeared to be inconsistent with a normal arm's-length commercial relationship. A particularly notable aspect of this cooperation related to the pricing of PPCs from the exporter to the importer, which, at least in one case, appeared to vary according to whether or not the PPCs were subject to anti-dumping duty, thus raising the suspicion of absorption of the anti-dumping duty. Under these circumstances, it was considered that the criteria of Article 2 (8) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 had been met, in the sense that both an association and a compensatory arrangement appeared to exist which rendered the prices paid or payable between the exporter and the importer concerned unreliable. This importer and its subsidiaries in the Community were consequently treated as related importers within the meaning of Article 2 (8) (b). (66) The same factual circumstances, and the consequent qualification as a related importer, also prevented this importer from being treated as an OEM importer. An essential characteristic of sales to OEM importers is that exporters incur significantly lower costs in respect of such sales, as marketing, distribution, and maintenance is all done by the OEM importer under the latter's own brand name and for its own account. The exporter can therefore charge lower prices, resulting in the claim that genuine OEM export prices are at a different level of trade from brand sales and should, for the purpose of a fair comparison, be compared with a similar level of trade on the domestic market. In this respect, this importer did sell the PPCs imported from the exporter concerned under its own brand names in the Community. However, this is not in itself sufficient to qualify as an OEM importer. If it were, it would be very simple indeed for exporters to have their subsidiaries in the Community qualify for the status of OEM importer, simply by having them sell under a different brand name, as some exporters were found to have done in this review. In order for export sales to qualify as having been made at the level of trade of an OEM importer, the information regarding sales prices between exporter and importer and the costs borne by each must be reliable. This criterion is, by definition, not met between related parties within the meaning of Article 2 (8) (b). These conclusions were contested by the importer and exporter concerned. They argued that at least purchases ordered before the exporter's acquisition of its share holding should still be treated as unrelated. However, as described above, from the moment of that acquisition, the entire relationship between exporter and importer changed to a degree where the prices actually paid for all subsequent imports, whether ordered before or after the shareholding, became unreliable. The same applies to the costs. The fact that the Commission verified these costs and used them, with some corrections, to construct the export price, does not necessarily mean that these costs were accepted as entirely reliable. (67) The same considerations applied even more strongly to a second importer. During the investigation period of the review, a majority of the capital of this importer was owned by one of the Japanese exporters. Given the exporter's majority share in the company, prices between exporter and importer and the costs incurred by each were considered unreliable. Although the importer sold the PPCs which it imported from the exporter concerned under the importer's brand name in the Community, that brand name is in fact owned and controlled by the exporter concerned. This importer could, therefore, not be treated as an OEM importer. (68) In September 1991, the European headquarters of one of the Japanese exporters took a significant minority shareholding in a third importer, the name of which was changed in line with the brand name of the exporter concerned. As in the case of the first importer, this shareholding was so large as to make it likely, in the Comission's view, that the exporter was in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the importer. During the verification visit to this importer it was also found that advertising support was received from the exporter. It was therefore considered that also in this case an association or compensatory arrangement within the meaning of Article 2 (8) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 appeared to exist, which rendered the sales prices and distribution of costs between this importer and the exporter concerned unreliable. Facts available (69) A planned visit to a European subsidiary of one of the Japanese exporters could not take place, as the company did not supply necessary information regarding its cost structure in time. As a consequence, the Commission was not able to determine the costs incurred by this company in respect of sales made to first independent buyers by the other subsidiaries of the same group that had been visited. Based on the scarce information available to the Commission, it appeared, however, that the company clearly did perform functions that were of benefit to those other subsidiaries, such as collecting and disseminating marketing information, providing marketing assistance, standardizing accounting practices, giving legal assistance, undertaking pan-European advertising, providing services in the financial area, assisting in product development and product adaptation to the market, etc. In the absence of better, verified information, facts available had to be used, in accordance with Article 7 (7) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, in casu the SGA costs in the audited accounts of this company, to establish the costs incurred in providing the above - and possibly other - services. Export price for related importers (70) For related importers, export prices were constructed from the sales prices to the first independent buyers in the Community, minus discounts and rebates directly linked (including items free of charge), by deducting all costs incurred between importation and resale and a reasonable profit margin of 5 %. The profit levels found for unrelated importers could not be used to establish an appropriate profit margin, for two reasons. First, few unrelated importers replied to the questionnaire. Of these, the profit margin of one unrelated importer was verified, representing only a small percentage of total imports from Japan. Secondly, it was found that the profit margins of unrelated importers were artificially depressed, in line with the general price depression analysed further below for PPCs in the Community, as a result of having to compete with dumped Japanese brand sale imports sold through related subsidiaries in the Community. In the absence of reliable profit figures of unrelated importers, the Commission considered a 5 % profit margin a reasonable minimum in the ordinary course of trade, taking account of Commission practice in other cases, including in the original investigation. As requested by exporters, a single profit margin, always of 5 %, was used irrespective of the number of subsidiaries actually involved in the sales chain. (71) PPCs sold to dealers at a lower price for demonstration purposes were included in the transactions used to calculate dumping, as the cost of demonstration should normally be borne by the dealer himself. Depreciation of stock, covering missing or stolen products or damaged or obsolete products destined for disposal, was considered as a cost incurred between importation and resale. Where old stocks of PPCs were not depreciated but sold, these transactions were included in the dumping calculation. Export price for unrelated importers (72) Export prices to unrelated importers, normally OEM purchasers, were calculated based on the actual prices for these transactions, less discounts and rebates directly linked (including items free of charge). Compensation paid to OEM purchasers for disadvantageous exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the sale of PPCs was considered as discount. Where exporters' subsidiaries in the Community incurred costs in respect of these sales, by carrying out certain activities that would normally have been undertaken by the importer (for instance the provision of advertising support) or by performing a role similar to that of a re-invoicing agent, the costs involved and a reasonable profit margin were deducted, in accordance with Article 2 (8) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. In this respect, the same 5 % profit margin was applied as for all sales through related importers, based on the method of using the same profit margin irrespective of the number of subsidiaries involved. While one exporter commented that this percentage was relatively high in the case of sales to OEM importers, it was precisely this exporter which had insisted, in the original investigation, that one and the same profit percentage should be used irrespective of the number of subsidiaries involved in the sales channel. It was considered that the 5 % deduction by the Commission for reasonable profit was low in respect of sales in Member States in which two or sometimes even three related susidiaries were involved, as well as in respect of sales to end-users, which implied an integrated chain of distribution, and that, therefore, the approach followed was reasonable. 4. Comparison (73) Export prices and normal value were compared at the same level of trade. OEM export sales were compared with the weighted average normal value of OEM domestic sales. As for the own-brand export sales, which had to be constructed in almost all cases, these were compared with the weighted average normal value of all domestic own-brand sales channels, given that these were not consistently distinguishable from each other, and that therefore insufficient evidence existed that one type of sales channel would be more comparable to the export sales than another. (74) Where sufficient evidence was submitted, appropriate adjustments were made in respect of differences in physical characteristics and selling expenses. No adjustments were claimed for any difference in import charges and indirect taxes. With respect to salesmen's salaries, only the salaries paid to personnel wholly engaged in direct PPC selling activities were deducted, to the exclusion of staff that partly or entirely exercised management functions, and to the exclusion of service and sales support personnel. This approach was based on Article 2 (10) (c) (v) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, which states that an allowance can be granted only for personnel wholly engaged in direct selling activities. Where PPC salesmen were found to be selling other products or services as well, the turnover concerned was included for the purposes of calculating the percentage deduction for PPCs. The total allowances for normal value were calculated as an absolute amount per model per unit sold. This absolute amount, representing the allowable cost per unit actually incurred, was then deducted from the normal value calculated for the model in question. 5. Dumping margins (75) Dumping margins were calculated as the total absolute amount of dumping on verified import sales divided by the total cif value as declared to customs of all verified imports, whether or not dumped. The dumping margins for brand sales (only partly verified) and OEM sales (all verified) were weighted to take account of the actual ratio in terms of cif value between these two types of export sales. In this respect, dumping found for the verified part of the brand sales was considered representative of all brand sales. (76) In the case of related importers, the existing anti-dumping duty was deducted as a cost between importation and resale, in accordance with Article 2 (8) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. For PPCs over 75 copies per minute, no anti-dumping duty was in force and thus no anti-dumping duty was deducted. On this basis, the dumping margins found varied between 21,5 and 83,9 %. They were significantly higher for each exporter concerned than the rate of the original anti-dumping duty pertaining to that exporter. The weighted average dumping margin was 41,0 %. (77) The effect of this high degree of dumping on the Community market place was far from being completely offset by the existing anti-dumping duty. When, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the original anti-dumping duty, this duty was not deducted as a cost in the case of related importers, and added to the export price in the case of unrelated importers, the weighted average effect of the dumping on the Community market was still as high as 28,8 %, with individual rates varying between 13,5 and 74,4 %. (78) In conclusion, the review showed that the existing anti-dumping duty has not led exporters to revise their pricing to an extent that dumping was eliminated, nor has it offset the effect of the dumping on the Community market. Given the high dumping margins found in the review investigation, it is considered that if the existing duty were allowed to lapse, dumping would be likely to continue at the same or even higher margins. The abolition of the anti-dumping duty can, if anything, only further increase the level of dumping to the extent that the lower costs for exporters selling in the Community through related importers could result in further price decreases. G. RECURRENCE OF INJURY 1. Effect of dumped imports from Japan (79) Despite the existing anti-dumping duty, Japanese exporters, selling mostly through related importers, were, in the investigation period of the review, undercutting the prices of the Community industry in the Community market place with their PPCs imported from Japan by a weighted average of 26 %, with a sales volume that, although significantly declining, still represented 26 % of units placed in the Community. As PPCs are a mature product, with relatively limited technical differences among producers and with price thus playing an important role in the customer's choice, it is clear that such a large volume of imports at such low prices could not fail to have a significant negative impact on the economic performance of the Community industry, showing itself in insufficient profitability and declining market shares and production volumes for that industry. (80) Any reduction in injury that might be derived from the decrease over time in the Community market share of Japanese PPCs, has been offset by the fact that in terms of models, those imports have become especially injurious. In the original investigation the large bulk of imports from Japan consisted of small PPCs. These gave the Japanese exporters a large market share measured in units, but their injurious effect was limited by the fact that Océ and Rank Xerox had traditionally focused on the more important large PPCs and continued to have a strong technical and market position and adequate profitability on those large models. Since then, however, almost all of the Japanese exporters have shifted a large part of their production of small PPCs (in particular mature models of relative simplicity) to the Community or to other third countries and have concentrated on exporting to the Community the more sophisticated segment 4, 5 and 6 models they have come to produce in Japan. In view of the fact that a weighted average degree of undercutting was determined for segments 4 and 5 which was twice the level of undercutting for segments 1 to 3 (38 % compared to 19 %), the imports from Japan exerted very strong downward pressure on the prices, profitability and market share of the Community industry in these segments. For instance, in segment 4 (PPCs capable of making 45 to 59 copies per minute), Community industry's market share in the Community decreased from 64,4 % in 1988 to 42,1 % in the investigation period of the review, a dramatic fall of 22,3 %. Most of the segment 4 PPCs and all segment 5 PPCs competing with the segment 4 PPCs of the Community industry in the investigation period of the review were produced in Japan. (81) Given the pricing aggressiveness of the Japanese exporters already found with the existing anti-dumping duty in force, it is considered that undercutting and price depression caused by dumped imports from Japan could only worsen if the duty were allowed to lapse, as Japanese exporters would be likely to use at least part of the cost reduction resulting for their related importers from an expiry of the anti-dumping duty to reduce yet further resale prices in the Community. This likelihood is considered all the greater as the introduction of lower prices by just one major player in the PPC market would, for such a price-sensitive product, put great pressure on the other players to follow suit, leading to an even more ruinous price war than already exists. The consequences of any further price decrease for the Community industry would be serious, as PPCs constitute for each producer the mainstay of their business, which should provide the profits necessary to make the investments required to remain viable in the medium term. Any of these firms could decide to stop production and become a mere OEM purchaser, deriving revenue from service and supplies only, as other Community producers have already been forced to do in past years. They could also replace part of their range of own-manufactured models with OEM purchases. The experience of recent years has shown that parts of the Community industry's own production, especially in the lower segments, had to be sacrificed when losses became too great. The aggressiveness of Japanese exporters' pricing in the higher segments means that danger could now arise even for the higher segments. (82) With respect to volumes of imports, during the investigation period of the review, the economic situation in Japan deteriorated, demand stagnated, and stocks increased by 65 % to a level of 300 000 units, more than the annual volume of exports to the Community during the investigation period Capacity utilization was also decreasing. If duties were allowed to lapse, the incentive to increase exports from Japan to the Community, at prices covering variable costs of production at most, would be great, quite possibly even to the extent of closing Japanese PPC factories in the Community in order to improve capacity utilization in Japan. The existing trend towards decreasing volumes of imports from Japan could thus be stopped or even reversed if duties were allowed to lapse. This would be even more likely if the yen were to depreciate in the coming years against the European currencies. With the behaviour of currencies being as volatile as it is, this development cannot be excluded. 2. Other allegedly injurious factors (83) The Commission examined whether a fall in demand for PPCs in the Community market could have caused the precarious situation of the Community industry. This was not found to be the case. Between 1988 and the investigation period of the review the Community market for PPCs expanded by 24 %. However, the Community industry's sales in the Community declined by 1 % over the same period, leading to a decrease in their market share in the Community from 15,4 to 12,4 %. (84) The argument by some exporters that a period of economic recession in the Community was the cause of the precarious situation of the Community industry in the investigation period of the review, is also considered to be unfounded. The economic recession in the Community began, except in the United Kingdom, only in the second half of 1992, after the end of the investigation period. Thus, while total PPC consumption has decreased by around 10 % following the end of the investigation period, it had still been climbing strongly between 1988 and the investigation period and remained stable during the investigation period itself. To the extent that demand may have shifted somewhat towards second-hand PPCs, the Community industry did not suffer from this, as it is strongly represented in this market (as are the dealers of the Japanese producers). Furthermore, while the profitability of the Community industry in the Community for its products and services other than PPCs declined from an index of 100 in 1988 to 76 in the investigation period of the review, Community industry's profitability on PPC hardware sales in the Community dropped much more steeply from an index of 100 in 1988 to 24 in the investigation period of the review. This suggests that sales of PPCs by the Community industry were under severe additional pressure from sources other than the general economic conditions. Some exporters commented that the relatively better performance of overall profitability could be due to customers postponing the replacement of their PPC and spending more on maintaining their existing PPC. However, as mentioned above, between 1988 and the investigation period, sales of PPCs in the Community increased by 24 %, which contradicts the argument that customers had postponed purchases of new machines. (85) It was suggested by certain exporters that PPCs produced by Japanese companies in the Community and in third countries had also been causing injury to the Community industry, and that the Commission should quantify what part of the injury should be attributed to each. It may be observed, in this respect, that neither of these two other sources of sales in the Community was the object of the present review, so that the possibility for the Commission to obtain relevant information was limited. Furthermore, none of the Japanese exporters volunteered any information on the degree to which their PPCs produced in third countries other than Japan and in the Community were alleged to cause injury to the Community industry. Nevertheless, it was considered reasonable to assume that the prices of PPCs which Japanese companies produce in the Community and which they produce in and import from third countries other than Japan are not likely to be significantly out of line with the prices of PPCs imported from Japan, as major price differences in the Community between similar PPCs produced by the same company probably could not be sustained. In this sense, it was considered likely that PPCs sold by Japanese companies from these sources other than Japan likewise contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry. It was also noted that the relative importance in the Community market of PPCs from these other sources had increased continuously, to a market share of 61,8 % in the investigation period of the review (consisting of 12,8 % imports from third countries other than Japan and 49 % estimated Community sales of PPCs produced by Japanese companies in the Community. Nevertheless, the market share of 26 % held by the imports from Japan, combined with the undercutting level of 26 % found for those imports, is considered to be in itself a significant cause of the poor economic situation of the Community industry. In order to defend its market share against such a large volume of unfairly low-priced imports, the Community industry was forced to lower its own sales prices to levels that resulted in an important shortfall of profitability on their sales of PPCs. The argument that PPCs of Japanese companies from other sources were probably sold at similarly low prices, does not change the fact that even in their absence the Community industry would still have had no choice but to follow the price lead of the imports from Japan, sold as they were in such important volumes. Those imports were, therefore, taken in isolation, sufficient to cause price depression and a significant shortfall in profitability for the Community industry. As mentioned before, they were also the main cause of the dramatic loss of market share of the Community industry in segment 4 PPCs and the sole cause of sales lost by the Community industry in segment 6, since all segment 5 and segment 6 PPCs and the great majority of segment 4 PPCs introduced by Japanese companies on the Community market in the investigation period of the review originating in Japan. For the other segments, imports from Japan probably combined with PPCs from other sources to cause loss of market share and lack of profitability to the Community industry. Although Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 requires the Community authorities not to attribute to dumped imports injuries caused by other factors, this requirement is satisfied where it is shown, as described above, that dumped imports, taken in isolation, have been an independent cause of the poor economic situation of the Community industry, even if other factors may also have contributed to that situation. Thus, even if it were assumed that imports from other third countries and sales from Japanese production facilities in the Community have contributed to the precarious situation of the Community industry, this would not alter the fact that dumped imports from Japan, taken in isolation, caused the poor economic situation of the Community industry. (86) As for the argument that the Community industry inflicted injury upon itself by importing and selling in the Community PPCs originating in Japan, it has already been mentioned that the number of PPCs imported from Japan by the Community industry and sold in the Community in the investigation period of the review declined dramatically in comparison with the original investigation. The percentage of PPCs imported by the Community industry from Japan and sold in the Community in the investigation period of the review represented less than 1 % of its production of PPCs. Any negative impact of such imports on the situation of the Community industry can therefore be ignored. Not only was the quantity of PPCs imported from Japan by the Community industry very small, the fact of buying part of one's product range from other producers is now a common and normal business strategy even among Japanese producers. Selling dumped PPCs from Japan in the Community, as practised by Océ, but not by the other two Community producers, may be seen as a legitimate act of self-defence in view of the need to sell in the Community market in competition with other dumped PPCs from Japan. Indeed, had Océ failed to do this, the injury on its own-manufactured PPCs would in all likelihood have been larger still, as it would then have lost a number of customers needing an assortment of PPCs ranging from small to large. 3. Conclusion (87) The above considerations, and in particular the finding that notwithstanding the existing anti-dumping duty, significant volumes of highly dumped imports from Japan were sold on the Community market at very low prices, causing serious detriment to the Community industry, lead to the conclusion that if the anti-dumping duty in force were allowed to lapse, material injury caused by dumped imports from Japan would recur. H. COMMUNITY INTEREST 1. General (88) The general purpose of anti-dumping measures is to eliminate trade-distorting effects of dumping practices and thus to restore effective competition on the Community market. Effective competition is fundamentally in the Community interest, both as a general policy objective and in terms of the interests of Community producers and consumers. 2. Original findings (89) With respect to the specific case of dumped PPC imports from Japan, the interests of producers, consumers and unrelated (mainly OEM) importers, such as Agfa Gevaert, in the Community had already been examined extensively in the original investigation. At that time, it was concluded that the Community's interest in maintaining a viable Community PPC manufacturing industry capable of competing with imports from Japan on fair terms outweighed the short-term interest of consumers in profiting from unfairly low prices, for as long as they would last, as well as the interests of OEM importers, who profited from distributing, under their own brand, dumped imports from Japan at the expense of sales of PPCs produced by Community industry. Regarding OEM importers it was considered, in particular, that the Community interest in a Community industry which both produces and distributes PPCs is, other things being equal, greater than in European companies which essentially distribute under their own brand PPCs produced in Japan. 3. Findings in the review Community interest in PPC production (90) With respect to the Community's interest in maintaining a viable PPC industry in the Community, this has, if anything, increased from the time of the original investigation. It is estimated that close to 23 000 people are employed full-time in the Community to manufacture, distribute, service and sell the PPCs produced by the Community industry, of whom 12 000 are employed in manufacturing (including those working full-time at Community companies supplying parts and sub-assemblies for Community PPC producers). While PPC technology has become mature, it is still a highly complex and sophisticated process, combining chemical, optical, electronic, mechanical and software know-how. The PPC of today also forms an important technological starting point not only for the production of digital copiers, printers and faxes, but also for a whole new generation of multi-purpose, networked office products to be introduced in the years to come. (91) Furthermore, after anti-dumping measures were introduced in 1986, almost all Japanese producers established or expanded PPC production facilities in the Community. As a result, Japanese PPC production in the Community, which had been less than 50 000 units in 1984, increased to 643 719 units in the investigation period of the review. Although the anti-dumping duties may not have been the only reason for this strongly increased Japanese production in the Community, it can hardly be doubted that they did significantly influence this development. In the wake of these factories, a strong supplier industry also developed within the Community, representing, in all likelihood, more employment than the Japanese factories in the Community themselves or than the 6 000 workers involved full-in supplying the Community industry. As already mentioned, if duties were to lapse, there would be an incentive for the Japanese exporters to cut production in the Community to reduce the significant stocks existing in Japan and to improve capacity utilization there. This rationale would apply especially to the larger PPCs, which could be supplied world-wide from a single source, Japan. In addition, the lapsing of the duties in the face of high dumping would probably be interpreted by the Japanese producers as meaning that the Community authorities no longer attached importance to maintaining a photocopier industry in the Community. As a result, the economic advantages of producing small and relatively simple PPCs in third countries with low labour costs, rather than in the Community where most Japanese companies produce them now, would become more alluring. There will be a point where cost/benefit considerations will outweigh even strategic considerations relating to maintaining a manufacturing presence in the main global markets, especially since at least one other Japanese producer has no production facilities at all in the Community and competes strongly on the Community market with PPCs made with low labour costs in a third country. If this trend were followed, the final result could be a severely limited Japanese PPC manufacturing presence in the Community. If the production of several if not all of the Japanese production facilities were to be closed or switched to other products, this would be serious in itself. However, probably the biggest disadvantage would be that a myriad of small and medium-sized Community suppliers now providing the Japanese assembly facilities with parts, would be without clients. It is precisely this strong reliance by the Japanese assembly facilities on outside suppliers, entailing minimal capital investment in assembly plants, that would limit their shutdown costs if they decided to cease assembly in the Community. Interest of importers (92) Certain importers claimed that they suffered from the anti-dumping duty in that they were unable, whether partially or entirely, to pass this cost on to consumers, leading to reduced profitability and loss of employment in their companies. It is evident that the imposition of an anti-dumping duty is not to the advantage of importers, which have to pay the anti-dumping duty and which are therefore less able than before to undercut the prices of the Community industry with dumped imports. However, it is precisely the intention of the introduction of an anti-dumping duty that the sales prospects for the Community industry be improved in relation to those of importers selling dumped products. In addition, it was noted that this claim was made by importers, such as Agfa Gevaert, which sell the PPCs which they purchase in Japan under their own brand in the Community. The profitability of such companies is likely to have been affected at least as much by the tendency of their Japanese PPC suppliers gradually to expand their own brand sales network in the Community at the expense of sales under the importer's brand. While some employment in sales and service activities may have shifted from these importers to the Community industry or to Japanese sales subsidiaries in the Community, this employment remained in the Community. This situation should be distinguished from the net loss of manufacturing employment which, as described above, it at stake for the Community if duties were allowed to lapse. The importer Agfa Gevaert also advanced the argument that the anti-dumping measures on PPCs from Japan endangered its direct investments in PPCs in Japan. Upon verification, however, it was found that such no direct investments existed. Interest of Community consumers (93) It was estimated that an amount of around ECU 500 million was collected in anti-dumping duties on PPC imports from Japan from their introduction in August 1986 to the end of the investigation period. However, given the continued effect of dumping on the Community market and the high undercutting margins found, it would appear that a large part of this amount was not charged to Community consumers. (94) If duties were allowed to expire, consumers would benefit to the extent that the Japanese exporters and unrelated importers decided to use their reduced costs to further decrease resale prices in the Community of PPCs imported from Japan. If maintaining the duty led to no price movement, the situation would continue as mentioned in recital 93. If maintaining the duty led to a price increase to consumers with the full amount of the anti-dumping duty, if imports continued at the same level as at present, and if PPCs not imported from Japan did not increase in price, the estimated cost to Community consumers of a continuation of the measures would be ECU 42,5 million per year. This figure is based on a weighted average anti-dumping duty of 16,3 % for the exporters investigated, multiplied by a total customs value of PPCs imported from Japan in 1994 of ECU 260,8 million. Such a price increase on PPCs imported from Japan would, however, be quite unlikely, given that the duty would remain at the same level as before. Even if a price increase of PPCs from Japan did take place, it would be likely to lead to their partial or complete replacement by PPCs from other sources, whether from sales by the Community industry or from sales of PPCs produced by the Japanese companies in the Community or in other third countries. The Community industry would probably want to use part of the breathing space created to increase sales volumes rather than increase prices up to the full margin possible. As for the Japanese producers, there is no reason why they would change the pricing strategy of their PPCs not imported from Japan, especially because they compete among themselves and are still subject to competition from low-priced imports from third countries other than Japan. A general price increase of all PPCs sold in the Community is therefore extremely unlikely. In general, in a competitive market for a mature product such as photocopiers, it takes only one or a few large sellers to force the general price level down, but it takes a general cost increase or the participation of all or most large sellers to get the general price level up. If one company increased its prices in isolation, it would be forced to rethink this strategy very quickly. (95) It is in the long-term interest of consumers to maintain a variety of sources of supply and competition. Two of the smaller Japanese exporters observed that their continued operation might be endangered if the anti-dumping duty on PPC imports from Japan were maintained, which would reduce competition. However, of these two companies one was already majority-owned by one of the largest Japanese companies, while the other exported the bulk of its PPCs to the Community from a third country. The Community authorities were, therefore, more concerned about the reduction in sources and variety of supply which could result from the disappearance of one or more of the remaining Community producers. Around 85 % of the Community market measured in units (and around 70 % measured in units weighted by copy volume) was already in the hands of the nine Japanese exporters investigated, whether exporting from Japan, from third countries, or producing in the Community, even though, as mentioned above, these Japanese companies did compete among themselves during the investigation period of the review. (96) Some exporters and one importer pointed to the strong position in terms of market share of the Community industry in segment 6 to argue that this segment, or part of it, should be excluded from the duties. However, given that Rank Xerox, Océ and Kodak sell in segment 6 and compete between themselves, and that anti-dumping duties will not prevent Japanese exporters from exporting segment 5 or segment 6 PPCs to the Community (or from producing them in the Community or third countries), but merely from selling them at unfairly low prices, it was considered that this alleged risk to competition in segment 6 was outweighed by the Community industry's interest in receiving protection from dumped imports. This is the more so as segment 6 should not be considered as a product in itself, but merely as a small part of a product, PPCs, in which Japanese companies occupy a very strong market position in the Community. 4. Conclusion (97) It was considered that, on balance, it is in the overall Community interest that anti-dumping measures on PPC imports from Japan should not be allowed to expire at this time. I. MEASURES 1. General (98) The question governing this review was, in accordance with Article 15 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, whether the expiry of the measures in force would lead again to injury or threat of injury. Based on the above analysis, this question must be answered in the affirmative. Taking account of the Community interest, the Council concluded that anti-dumping measures should be maintained. 2. Product scope (99) When the anti-dumping measures on PPCs from Japan were first introduced, PPCs capable of operating at a speed of more than 75 copies per minute of A4 size paper were excluded from the scope of the measures, as there were, at that time, no imports from Japan of those copiers. Since then, however, such imports, at dumped prices, have increased strongly and were shown to be especially injurious to the Community industry. It was therefore deemed necessary now to include such PPCs in the scope of the measures. The new measures will thus cover the entire product investigated, i.e. PPCs ranging from personal copiers to segment 6. Personal copiers, although not produced by the Community industry, compete with segment 1 PPCs that were produced by the Community industry during the investigation period, and their continued inclusion is therefore justified. For segment 6 PPCs, already one Japanese exporter had started importing such PPCs into the Community, while there is also competition with segment 5, which is dominated by the Japanese exporters. If either personal copiers or segment 6 copiers were excluded from the measures, not only would dumped imports in these segments continue to injure the Community industry, but the risk of circumvention of the anti-dumping measures on segments 1 and 5 would be considerable, as it would be possible for exporters to change the copy speed or features of the PPC in such a manner as to fall within the adjoining segment, without essentially changing the model. These considerations are not invalidated by the fact that on a weighted average basis, the Community industry obtained an adequate return on sales of segment 6 PPCs during the investigation period. First, the operating results for individual Community producers on segment 6 PPCs differed substantially, with one of the two Community producers suffering losses in that segment. Secondly, injury was determined for the like product as a whole, in accordance with Article 4 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. The profitability of the Community industry, one of the key injury criteria, would have been worse if segment 6 had been excluded. Thirdly, in contrast to the situation prevailing in the original investigation period, segment 6 is now both produced in the Community and imported from Japan. It would be inappropriate to identify injury for each product segment or each model separately and to exclude from the measures segments or models that happened to be commercially more successful during the investigation period. 3. Rates of the duty (100) It was considered that the existing anti-dumping duty has been effective in significantly reducing the volume of PPC imports from Japan, and that other factors, notably the prices and volumes of PPCs sold in the Community and produced by Japanese companies in the Community and in third countries other than Japan, were likely to be contributing to the precarious situation of the Community industry. On balance, therefore, the Council considered that confirming the existing duty at its current levels should give adequate protection to the Community industry, given the continuous downward trend in PPC imports from Japan and the fact that the measures will now cover PPCs capable of operating at a speed of more than 75 copies per minute of A4 size paper. (101) Some exporters and the Community industry argued that the rate of the new anti-dumping duty should be amended for each exporter based on the lower of its dumping and underselling margins. They noted that the review investigation had been initiated not only on the basis of Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, but also of Article 14 of that Regulation, and that Article 14 (3) provided for the amendment, where warranted, of the measures in force. They claimed that discrimination occurred between exporters, as lower duty rates were applied to some than others whilst they had similar dumping or underselling margins, and the same duty rate was applied to other exporters even though they had different dumping or underselling margins. In this respect, the following observations should be made: Firstly, Articles 14 and 15 appear together under the heading 'review` in Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. Article 15 should, therefore, be read in conjunction with Article 14, especially the procedural provisions thereof. Secondly, the word 'confirmed` in Article 15 (1) would serve no purpose if the new measures always had to be based on the lower of the dumping and underselling margins, since it is highly unlikely that the duty rates derived from such a calculation would, for each exporter, be identical to the existing rates, resulting in the existing duties being 'confirmed` by the review investigation. The Community authorities nevertheless clearly have the right under Article 15 (1) to 'confirm` the existing measures. Thirdly, the confirmation of existing measures is especially appropriate where they have had some beneficial effect, as in this case through the significant reduction of the volume of imports, but not yet enough to permit their expiry. In the present case, it is considered that maintaining the duty rates at their current level will in fact provide adequate protection to the Community industry, and that it is therefore simply not necessary to increase the duty rates. Finally, with respect to the claim of discrimination between exporters, it should be noted that the existing rates now confirmed by the Council are, for each exporter, significantly lower than its dumping and underselling margins found in the review, calculated in the manner indicated above. While the difference in benefit is larger for some exporters than for others, the same result is inherent in the 'lesser duty` rule laid down in Article 13 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, under which the same duty rate based on injury may be applied to all exporters, even though some have higher dumping margins than others. In the original investigation, for instance, the duty rate based on a global injury assessment was 20 % for all exporters (except those with lower dumping margins), even though the dumping margin of these exporters varied between 22 and 60 %. The degree to which the three exporters with lower duty rates now benefit, compared to the lower of their dumping and underselling margins, is not necessarily larger than the degree of benefit of exporters to which a 20 % duty rate is applied, as compared to the lower of their dumping and underselling margins. (102) The exporter Ricoh claimed that it was the only exporter whose dumping margin had decreased and that it should be rewarded for this is in the sense that the existing anti-dumping duty should not be deducted to calculate its new dumping margin. On that basis, it claimed a lower duty than 20 %. It was found that Ricoh was correct in claiming that it was the only exporter whose dumping had decreased since the original investigation. This circumstance cannot, however, lead to the non-deduction of the existing anti-dumping duty for the determination of the duty to be applied, since Article 2 (8) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 clearly provides that anti-dumping duties should be deducted as a cost for related importers in the calculation of the export price. In terms of injury, the reduction in this exporter's dumping margin could just as well have been due to a decrease in its normal value. The undercutting margin for this exporter, which was just below the weighted average for all exporters, supports this hypothesis and indicates that its export prices contributed to the poor economic situation of the Community industry. Its claim for a reduced duty was therefore not considered justified or possible pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. 4. Period of operation (103) With respect to the period of operation of the measures, the Council noted that, due to the unusual complexity of a number of aspects of this case, significant delays were incurred in its treatment. First, nearly six months elapsed between the notice of the Commission's intention to carry out a review of the measures and the actual initiation of that review. Then, the review investigation itself, which was initiated on 14 August 1992, took more than three years to complete. In accordance with Article 15 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the original anti-dumping duty on PPC imports from Japan remained in force during this entire period. The Council therefore considers it reasonable that, in these exceptional circumstances, the period of operation of the new measures should be limited, to expire two years after their entry into force, subject to the applicable provisions on reviews. (104) Some exporters and importers commented that the Community industry had already had eight years of protection through anti-dumping measures, that this was long enough, and that the measures should now be allowed to lapse. However, there is no statutory time limit to the period of operation of anti-dumping measures other than the five-year period mentioned in Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. As that Article itself makes clear, a review held at the end of this time limit can, where warranted, lead to the confirmation, as in this case, of the existing measures for a new period. Also, while the existing anti-dumping measures have been in force for eight years, this review has shown that their effectiveness in protecting the Community industry has been limited by the fact that due to the behaviour of the Japanese exporters the effect of dumping on the Community market, manifested by price depression and undercutting, remains substantial. 5. Residual duty (105) The verification visits to cooperating exporters covered the near totality of PPC exports from Japan to the Community during the investigation period. It was considered appropriate that for those companies which did not cooperate in this review, the residual duty be set at the highest of the individual duty rates for the exporters investigated, i.e. at 20 %, in the absence of any information justifying a higher or lower level. The same rate should apply for those companies which did not export to the Community during the investigation period. However, for the latter companies, this is subject to the possibility of a newcomer review pursuant to Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 3283/94. 6. Undertakings (106) It was considered that the undertaking of Kyocera Corporation, Kyoto, under which it was committed to giving the Commission sufficient advance notice if it were to recommence exports to the Community, should be allowed to lapse. (107) As regards the undertakings given pursuant to Article 13 (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the Commission has received regular information enabling it to verify the undertakings given. The weighted average value of parts and materials of Japanese origin used in the assembly or production of PPCs in the Community has remained at less than 60 % of the total value of all parts and materials. The undertakings will lapse at the end of the investigation, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 1. A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of plain paper photocopiers falling within CN codes ex 9009 12 00 (Taric code: 9009 12 00*19) and ex 9009 21 00 (Taric code: 9009 21 00*19), originating in Japan. 2. For the purpose of this Regulation, plain paper photocopiers shall be understood to mean analogue, indirect-process copiers incorporating an optical system, irrespective of their copy speed and whether imported as a whole or in modules. Such copiers are formed by four basic elements, i.e. imaging, photo-conducting or developing, transfer or fixing and paper transport system. Digital copiers, which use a scanner and an image processor to transform an original image into a digital signal and then recompose that signal, with or without changes, into a copy, do not form part of this proceeding and are thus not subject to the duty. In addition, the following products shall not be subject to the duty: - analogue full-colour copiers (machines which have the capacity to make full colour copies automatically from corresponding coloured originals in one copying cycle by means of a polychromatic process), - aperture card reader printers and microfilm printers (machines which have the capacity to read images from and make enlarged copies of microfilms, microfiches and aperture cards), - whiteboard copiers (machines which have the capacity to make copies from information displayed on screens), and - large format copiers (machines capable of making copies of A2 size and larger from originals larger than A2 size). For the avoidance of doubt, highlight PPCs (PPCs which reproduce only a few colours to draw attention to certain segments of a document) and A2 size PPCs (PPCs capable of making A2 size paper copies - but not larger - from A2 size paper originals or larger) shall be subject to the duty. 3. The rate of the duty shall be 20 % of the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty (Taric additional code: 8841), with the exception of imports which are manufactured by the following companies, which shall be subject to the following rates of duty: - Copyer Company Limited, Tokyo: 7,2 % (Taric additional code: 8838), - Mita Industrial Company, Osaka: 12,6 % (Taric additional code: 8839), - Toshiba Corporation, Tokyo: 10 % (Taric additional code: 8840). Article 2 Regulation (EEC) No 535/87 is hereby repealed. Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. It shall expire two years after its entry into force, save that should any review of the measures adopted by this Regulation be pending on that date, it shall remain in force until that review is concluded. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. Done at Luxembourg, 2 October 1995.",formal

"(InStyle) -- After years in the bronze age, when sun-kissed cheeks and gloss reigned supreme, fall's return to glamour means that lipstick is making a major comeback. Lipstick outsold gloss by $76 million last year, and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas that are more wearable than ever. So pucker up. We'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly, along with the most flattering shades for day and night. For foolproof application, stick with sheer, subdued shades in the morning and save deep, bold colors (which require more time and precision) for night. Daytime equation . 1. Condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen, like Softlips Raspberry with Green Tea SPF 20. ""Dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower, when your lips are still a little moist,"" suggests Hollywood pro Kara Yoshimoto Bua. The smoother your lips, the more perfect your lipstick will look. 2. Choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube. A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color. Try Neutrogena Moistureshine Soothing Lipsheers in Fresh Rose. 3. Blot, reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain, says Bua. ""The color looks more natural and lasts longer."" Instead of tissues, use lint-free blotting papers, like Boscia Fresh Blotting Linens ($10). Nighttime equation . 1. Exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy. Sally Hansen Gentle Peel for Rough Lips ($10; at drugstores) uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches. 2. Create a base with a gel-based primer that fills in fine lines around the mouth and helps lipstick go on more smoothly. One to try: Olay Regenerist lip treatment ($19; at drugstores). 3. Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding, says Robin Fredriksz, who gave Barrymore her deep fuchsia lip. To avoid an unnaturally dark outline, use a shade that's lighter than your lipstick, like Revlon Colorstay lip liner in Plum ($8; at drugstores). 4. Brush on color for more control. Try: Shu Uemura Kolinsky Portable Extra lipbrush ($35) with Isadora Perfect Moisture lipstick in Bordeaux Red ($11). Makeup artists' favorites . Just like us, cosmetics pros use the same lipsticks again and again. From the just right daytime rose to the classic evening red, here are some of their all-time go-to picks for day and night. Carmindy's neutral picks for day are designed to ""enhance your natural lip color."" For night she recommends dark berry or true red for all skin tones. Her clients: Heidi Klum and Jamie-Lynn Sigler. Day shades: Benefit Silky Finish in Candy Store, $16; Givenchy Rouge Interdit in Secret Pink, $26. Night colors: Nars in Scarlet Empress, $23; Revlon Super Lustrous in Love That Red, $8; at drugstores. AJ Crimson likes a subtle pink or sheer beige for all skin tones during the day. For night he recommends bright red for fair complexions and a deep purple for darker ones. His clients: Missy Elliot and Amerie. Day shades: Chanel Rouge Hydrabase in Pink Sugar, $25; Laura Mercier in Candy Pink, ($22). Night colors: Maybelline Moisture Extreme in Royal Red, $7; at drugstores; MAC in Cyber, ($14). Melissa Silver uses fuchsia on cool skin tones and peachy nude on warm ones for day. For night, she says, ""anyone can wear plum or sheer red."" Her clients: Renée Zellweger and Cindy Crawford. Day shades: Clinique Colour Surge Butter Shine in Fresh Watermelon, $14; Lancôme Le Rouge Absolu in Nectariche, $25. Night colors: MAC in Spice It Up!, $14; Sonia Kashuk in Sheer Cherry Blossom, $8.

As the countdown begins to November 4, 2008, the New York Democrat continues to dominate the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and comes out ahead when voters are asked whether they prefer her or the GOP front-runner, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. But Clinton's path to the White House is in no way certain. Clinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week, and her rivals for the Democratic nomination have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on her position on Iraq, Iran and other major issues. The Republican presidential candidates have also stepped up their attacks on the Democratic front-runner, with each suggesting that he has the best chance of stopping Clinton. The attacks may be working. The CNN/Opinion Research polls suggests that Clinton's support has slipped from its height one month ago. Watch CNN's Bill Schneider on the latest poll numbers » . ""Clinton's strength is about where it was throughout the summer, indicating that she has lost the support she gained last month but that Obama has not yet cut into her core constituency,"" CNN political director Keating Holland said. Clinton is the top choice of 44 percent of the likely Democratic voters interviewed for the poll. Her closest rival, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, was the top choice of 25 percent, and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina has 14 percent. All other Democratic candidates were in single digits. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was backed by 4 percent, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware by 3 percent, Sen. Christopher Dodd by 2 percent, Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich by 2 percent and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel was at 1 percent. The poll involved 467 interviews conducted on November 2-4 with Democrats or independents who lean Democratic. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. View the poll results » . In an October CNN/Opinion Research poll, Clinton was supported by 51 percent of Democratic voters and had a 30 point lead over Obama. During last week's Democratic debate, Clinton received heavy criticism from her fellow Democratic presidential rivals, who are desperate to shake up the presidential race just months before the first voting occurs in the Iowa Caucus in early January. Edwards was particularly aggressive during the debate, criticizing Clinton for her stance on Iraq, Iran and Social Security. ""The American people ... deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth and won't say one thing one time and something different at a different time,"" Edwards said. Edwards has also accused Clinton of being a ""corporate Democrat"" too willing to defend a ""corrupt"" Washington establishement. ""We desperately need in the next president someone that recognizes we have a system in Washington that's become broken, corruption has crept into it, and we have to tell the truth about that,"" Edwards said Monday. ""If you defend that system, I don't believe you can bring about the change that America needs."" In the Republican presidential race, Giuliani continues to be the leading candidate, with the backing of 28 percent of the Republican primary voters polled. Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee was backed by 19 percent. Sen. John McCain of Arizona was the top pick of 16 percent, and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney had 11 percent. Of the remaining Republican candidates, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee received 10 percent, Texas Rep. Ron Paul 5 percent, California Rep. Duncan Hunter 4 percent and Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo 3 percent. The poll involved telephone interviews with 397 Republicans or independents who lean Republican. The poll's margin of error was 5 percentage points. In a head-to-head matchup of the two front-runners, Clinton leads Giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent. That lead has increased since October, when Clinton led Giuliani 49 percent to 47 percent. ""The overall political environment seems to favor the Democrats, partly because Democratic voters are more enthusiastic about the coming election and partly because the public is in a sour mood, which is usually not a good sign for the incumbent party,"" Holland said. Only 42 percent of Americans think things are going well, while 58 percent think things are going badly, the poll found. ""The public is not just pessimistic about the country -- Americans are angry,"" Holland said. ""More than eight in 10 say they are angry about the way things are going in the country."" Clinton's lead over Giuliani would be greater if a third-party candidate entered the race who believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, the poll found. In a three-way race, Clinton would get the support of 48 percent of voters, Giuliani 32 percent and the third-party candidate 18 percent. The poll's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percent. ""My analysis of it is that [a third-party candidate] is more of an attempt to keep the nomination from me,"" Giuliani said. ""You know it is a tactic, and a legitimate one. People have to think about that and consider it.'' The lack of enthusiasm for Giuliani, particularly by social conservatives, could spell trouble for the GOP next year if he becomes the nominee, Holland said. ""Only 27 percent of Republicans say they would feel enthusiastic if Giuliani won the GOP nod, and the remaining GOP candidates fare even worse,"" he said. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"PATUAKHALI, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Survivors of a storm that killed more than 3,000 people in the impoverished nation of Bangladesh grieved and buried their loved ones Monday as they waited for aid to arrive. Villagers grieve in Patargata, around 125 miles south of Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, Monday. The number of dead killed from Cyclone Sidr -- now at 3,114 -- is expected to rise yet further as the South Asian nation continues to assess the damage. The Bangladesh Red Crescent fears the death toll could be 5,000 -- perhaps even reaching as high as 10,000. In the fishing village of Galachipa, in Patuakhali district, Dhalan Mridha was grieving for family members who died in the cyclone after ignoring an alert issued by authorities. ""Nothing is going to happen. That was our first thought and we went to bed. Just before midnight the winds came like hundreds of demons. Our small hut was swept away like a piece of paper, and we all ran for shelter,"" Mridha, a 45-year-old farm worker, told The Associated Press. On the way to a shelter, Mridha lost contact with his wife, mother and two children. The next morning he found their bodies. The Category 4 cyclone raked Bangladesh's southwest coast on Thursday with maximum sustained winds of 241 km/h (150 mph), destroying fishermen's hamlets and villages. Thousands are still missing, while an estimated 280,000 others are unable to return to their homes which were wiped out by the storm. Many grieving families are now burying loved ones in single graves as no male members are available to dig them. Most houses in the region are made of flimsy materials such as bamboo and corrugated iron, and had no chance of withstanding the storm's powerful winds. In addition, the storm-struck area is criss-crossed by a huge river delta which surged as Sidr pushed through, wiping out many villages and littering the river's shores with debris. Watch as people are left to fend for themselves » . Low-lying Bangladesh is already prone to flooding which has wiped out the country's rice production -- a major food staple for the impoverished country. Improved warning systems and shelters have kept the number of deaths far lower than the disastrous cyclones in the region of 1970 and 1991, when the tolls were in the hundreds of thousands. Bangladesh President Iajuddin Ahmed visited the devastated region Sunday, handing out some aid to the crowds of people before members of the international media. It was seen largely a token effort as hundreds were left empty-handed and furious. Security officials struggled to hold back the crowd. See dramatic photos of storm survivors » . Sidr has already ruined Bangladesh's rice harvest, but the international community is rallying to make sure the country does not suffer as acutely as it has in the past. Nearly a million people died after massive floods wiped out the country's rice production in 1974. International aid organizations promised initial packages of $25 million during a meeting with Bangladesh agencies Monday, the U.N.'s World Food Program said. The United States has offered more than $2 million as an initial contribution for emergency relief, and sent two U.S. Navy carriers to help in recovery operations. In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is airlifting in relief supplies and an 18-person Department of Defense medical team is in Bangladesh helping the estimated 15,000 injured by the storm. Bangladesh's government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues, Bangladeshi government spokesman Fahim Munaim told CNN. Officials fear the scope of the destruction may be much more extensive since there are remote areas where conditions cannot yet be determined. Munaim said nearly a third of Bangladesh's 64 districts were affected by the cyclone, most of those along the southern coast. The Bangladeshi military is working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced. International aid groups -- including Save the Children, World Vision, and the Red Crescent, which already have offices in Bangladesh -- are deploying resources to the cyclone-stricken region but -- like the government -- they have found it nearly impossible to reach the more remote areas to assess conditions. Roads to remote areas are either blocked by massive trees fallen by the storm, or so severely damaged that it is impossible for vehicles to use. Clearing could take weeks in the remote areas because it must be done by hand -- there are no chainsaws and modern machinery to speed up the process. Along the broken road that leads into Kolapara, the body of an 8-year-old girl called Rummie was carefully carried away for burial. Overwhelmed with sadness, her mother Khadija was steadied by a relative. ""I am feeling too much pain in my heart,"" she said. ""I have lost my daughter, so I am a victim of the cyclone as well.""

"I feel obliged to say that doing it properly makes a huge difference. Of course there are a variety of ways to smoke or vaporize it, but a key rule is keeping it in your lungs once you've inhaled it. Without this step you probably won't break through. There have been so many tales of extraordinary experiences on this drug, and I'm here to say that every time I've broken through has been a profound and memorable experience. Many people report seeing humanoid figures or other conscious beings (aliens?) reaching out to them. I can't say that this has been consistently true for me, but in the 10-15 time's I've tried it, I've broken through to have ""out-of-body"" experiences maybe 8 times. I've witnessed wholly hallucinated experiences from giant flowers made of soft peach-colored flesh bouncing to Animal Collective, to flying through a stone cavern at blinding speed on color-changing rapids to Battles. All with my eyes closed. What I can say is that it is unlike every other drug. You may reach an out-of-body experience that allows you to hallucinate things you ordinarily would not on other psychedelics like shrooms and LSD. The most prominent adjective I would use to describe a true DMT experience would be dream-like and meditative, not nightmarish or frightening. I have never had or seen anyone have a bad time on DMT. **tl;dr**: DMT is a drug unlike any other that can bring you outside of your own consciousness. A drug I believe everyone who is considering should try (correctly). edit: Forgot to mention that it usually lasts from 5-15 minutes when not combined with MAOIs. I typically sprinkle it on a bowl of weed and hold a lighter far enough away to vaporize/slightly combust the bud. IMO: if salvia is a freakish nightmare, DMT is a beautiful and lucid dream.",informal

"David Anderson QC said his ""central concern"" about the proposals first unveiled by David Cameron in early September was: ""Where are the courts?"" Temporary Exclusion Orders are one of the measures in the counter terrorism bill published by Theresa May. It also includes tougher powers to stop people going abroad to fight. It will include plans to stop some British citizens returning to the UK, and others from leaving the country. In other developments on Wednesday: Analysis by Political Correspondent Robin Brant The government proposes the law, parliament passes it, then David Anderson reviews it - and sometimes makes recommendations. That's the usual sequence of events. But today the independent reviewer was criticising the process before the new Counter-Terror and Security Bill was published. The QC used his customary polite, sometimes understated, tone - but this was a criticism of politicians whom he said hadn't fully thought through some of the proposals announced in early September. Read more from Robin Mrs May's new measures to tackle terrorism come days after she said the UK faces a ""greater"" terror threat than ever before. The measures include requiring airlines to pass on details of their passengers and changes to the way TPIMs - Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - work to monitor terror suspects who cannot be prosecuted. But campaigners have condemned it, saying it threatens civil liberties. 'A more sensible way' Mr Anderson - appointed by the government to be its independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - said the new anti-terror legislation was ""nothing like as dramatic"" as David Cameron had proposed earlier this year. He told the Joint Committee on Human Rights the original plan to block suspected British jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria as ""an announcement waiting for a policy"". But he said it soon became clear such a move would ""neither legally or practically"" work and the current plan was now much ""closer to managed return"". He argued there could be ""a more sensible"" way of dealing with some people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities. ""One could look at it in terms of young, possibly vulnerable people caught up with the wrong crowd in Syria - didn't really know exactly what they were doing,"" he said. ""Do you want to throw the book at them straight away in terms of arrest and charge? Or is there something to be said, even though you do suspect them of having fought, of keeping them under a very light regime where they might have to report daily to a police station? The new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill includes: ""They might have to notify their residence; they might have to go along to meetings with probation or with some similar which perhaps might be for some people be a more sensible way of dealing with them than putting them straight into the criminal justice process."" Mr Anderson said the use of exclusion orders would require the cooperation of carriers, such as airlines and of states where these people might find themselves. ""But certainly presented with an order at the check-in desk, the person might say: 'I want to come home,' or decide not to come home,"" he said. ""The concern I have about this power and the central concern about it is: where are the courts in all of this? ""If the home secretary wants to impose a TPIM she has to go to the court first and if the court says she's got it wrong, it will say so. ""One will want to look very carefully to see if this is a power that requires the intervention of the court at any stage, or whether it's simply envisaged as something the home secretary imposes. ""If one is abroad when this order is served on you, then it's a little difficult to see in practical terms how a right to judicial review could be exercised."" Mr Anderson spoke out as a week-long counter-terrorism awareness campaign enters its third day. 'Changing threats' The UK's terror threat level remains ""severe"" after it was upped from ""substantial"" earlier this year in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria. Speaking ahead of the bill's publication, Mrs May said: ""We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology. These powers are essential to keep up with the very serious and rapidly changing threats we face. ""This bill includes a considered, targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves."" The government wants to ""fast-track"" the bill through Parliament, citing the need to tackle the direct threat posed by the group calling itself Islamic State (IS) and the increasing number of Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight on its behalf. But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said more was needed to be done to stop British citizens from being radicalised and to deal with any threat this posed to national security. Amnesty International called the powers ""draconian"", adding none of the measures seemed ""properly thought through"". And Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said: ""Yet again, politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism. Another chilling recipe for injustice and resentment by closing down the open society you seek to promote."" The Home Office says communications data has played a major role in ""every Security Service counter-terrorism operation over the last decade"" but gaps in the UK's access to such information need to be filled. Mrs May has warned that even the new data retention powers will not fully address the threat, reiterating the need for a Communications Data Bill to bring in more wide-ranging web monitoring powers. That bill - labelled a snooper's charter by critics - was scrapped following Lib Dem opposition. Technology firms said there had been insufficient consultation on the more limited proposals in the bill requiring firms to keep information to help the authorities to match internet protocol (IP) addresses to an individual user or a device. The Home Office said it had met internet service providers and other groups to discuss the measures but the Internet Services Providers Association said there had been ""a distinct lack of engagement"" with the industry. Ministers want to amend legislation passed earlier this year to require firms to retain data, including that ""required to identify the sender or recipient of a communication, the time or duration of a communication, the type, method or pattern of communication and the telecommunications system used"". However, the bill stresses that the content of messages and details that would ""explicitly identify"" what websites someone had visited would not have to be stored. On Tuesday a report into last year's killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby raised questions about whether social network providers should have to report details of extremist activity. David Cameron said companies had a ""social responsibility"" to act on terrorist material posted online after the report detailed how Michael Adebowale, one of two men convicted of Mr Rigby's murder, spoke on Facebook about wanting to murder a soldier. Facebook said it did not allow terrorist content and aimed to stop it.",formal
"(InStyle) -- It all boils down to this. It doesn't really matter all that much what hot, nubile French maverick has set the fashion world on fire. Or which Milanese visionary has a new fabric technique discovered during a life-changing trip to Angkor Wat that's sure to bring back sixties minimalism with a twist. Or that so-and-so has signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries. Because, in the end, he's Ralph Lauren, and we're not. Ralph Lauren has his eye on China and Japan. For four decades no other designer has had a greater impact, not only on the way American men and women dress but also on the way they imagine, seek and indulge in the Good Life, than the former tie salesman from the Bronx. ""Those ties were handmade, by the way,"" recalls Lauren. ""Back then, ties, even designer ones, didn't sell for more than $5 apiece. Mine were $12 to $15. Such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary."" And ironic. Because while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony, Lauren originally named his company Polo because ""it was the sport of kings. It was glamorous, sexy and international."" See his designs » . In the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after Marco Polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of Lauren's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial. Lauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire, not just to be a success but to look like one before you'd even achieved your goal. What's more, Lauren made it look as easy as Fred Astaire dancing down a staircase. ""What matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible,"" says the designer. ""When I look at the people I've admired over the years, the ultimate stars, like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Astaire, the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency, whose naturalness is part of their excitement. And when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there, the ones you believe in and the ones you remember, like Chanel and Armani, are the ones that stand for something. Fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality. And it's an image that can change, that can evolve. It doesn't reinvent itself every two years."" However, with a media that is insatiable for the new, the now and the next, being steadfast doesn't always make for good copy. ""The spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer,"" Lauren admits. ""And that's fine. But the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else. We work real hard at that. It's about getting your message out to the consumer. It's about getting their trust, but also getting them excited, again and again. My clothes -- the clothes we make for the runway -- aren't concepts. They go into stores. Our stores. Thankfully, we have lots of them,"" says Lauren. ""What I rely on is people walking into my store saying, 'I want your clothes.'"" Well, if all of Lauren's customers shouted that together, he would go deaf faster than he could pull on one of his classic pullovers. Lauren's effortless luxury is all over the red carpet, on ski slopes and boats, at Wimbledon and elsewhere. It furnishes living rooms and graces dinner tables. It's on the bed, in the bed and under the bed -- and now sits on coffee tables, thanks to the tome Ralph Lauren (Rizzoli), celebrating his 40-years-and-growing career. But far from giving his customary over-the-head wave and riding off into his Colorado-ranch sunset, the designer is going even more global. ""Americans have a real inferiority about their own style. We've brought sportswear to the world, and yet we have a long way to go."" Already in Milan, London, Paris and Moscow, Lauren has more stores planned for China, Japan ... oh, everywhere. ""There aren't enough Americans out there,"" he says. Who better to start with than Ralph? Just as long as he doesn't let on that most of us still can't play a lick of polo. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Debra Lafave, the former Florida middle school teacher convicted of having sex with a student, violated her probation by hugging a young co-worker, a Florida judge found Thursday. Debra Lafave was arrested after talking with a teenager. She is not allowed to have contact with anyone under 18. But the judge did not send Lafave to jail, saying the violation was ""not willful and substantial."" ""Please don't come back,"" he scolded. Dressed in a tailored, black pantsuit, Lafave said she had ""innocent"" physical contact with a female co-worker she knew as under age 18. Watch Lafave in the courtroom » . At the time, she and the 17-year-old hostess worked at Danny Boy's, a small restaurant in the Tampa, Florida, area. Lafave, 27, pleaded guilty in November 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation. Lafave was required to register as a sex offender and ordered not to have any contact with minors. A tracking device she carries as part of her probation went off in court, prompting the prosecutor to observe, ""I think she's accounted for."" Lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact -- as well as conversations about sex -- with minors violated terms of her probation. She referred to the sexually explicit conversations at work as just ""girl talk."" Lafave denied talking about her sex life with co-workers. ""I don't speak that way about my personal life,"" she said. But she added that her co-workers spoke freely about sex in a ""small group setting."" While other co-workers socialized outside work, Lafave said, the 17-year-old was not included in those outings. Asked why she hugged the young co-worker, Lafave explained it was a small restaurant with a casual atmosphere where co-workers felt like family. The contact came, she said, ""out of my good nature, that's the way it worked."" The contacts that led to Thursday's probation violation hearing first surfaced during two polygraph tests administered as part of Lafave's court-ordered supervision. She received a verbal reprimand a year ago, according to testimony. When the behavior continued, her probation officer asked a judge to find her in violation. She was ordered to quit the restaurant job and now works as a receptionist in her mother's beauty shop. In the past, Lafave has said she suffers from bipolar disorder and is receiving treatment.

"This is according to a study revealing that 96% of the chicks are dying at two to three weeks old. Conservationists say that human activity has driven the birds to one remaining wetland, but that that site has insufficient food for the ducks. The research is published in the journal Bird Conservation International. The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), which led the research, estimates that only 25 individual birds now remain in the wild. Human activity, including deforestation, farming and fishing, has destroyed their habitat to the point that this last population is now restricted to one wetland in north-east Madagascar - a complex of lakes near Bemanevika. After the rediscovery of the species at this site in 2006, the WWT and its partners, including the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Peregrine Fund, set up a conservation breeding programme and began to monitor the wild birds. Dr Geoff Hilton, head of species research at the WWT, said that with such a small number of birds, keeping a close eye on the population was straightforward. ""We had about 10 or 11 females, [and] we were able to tell that most of those females were laying eggs, and those eggs were hatching,"" he told BBC News. But at the point when the ducklings were two to three weeks old, they would start disappearing. Piecing the evidence together, including samples of food from the bottom of the lake, the researchers realised that the chicks were starving to death. These diving ducks feed from the bottom of lakes, and this steep crater lake was simply too deep for them. WWT senior research officer Dr Andrew Bamford, who led the study, said: ""The last refuge of the Madagascar pochard is one of the last unspoilt wetlands in the country, but it's simply not suited to its needs. ""Something similar happened in the UK when the lowland red kite became confined to upland Wales, and in Hawaii, where the last nenes survived only on the upper slopes of volcanoes because introduced predators had occupied their favoured grassland habitats."" Dr Hilton added: ""What we think we're seeing is a bit of a classic wildlife conservation conundrum. ""The place where the species hangs on at the end is not a particularly good place for them - it's just the place that's been least badly affected by human activities."" But the researchers say the species could thrive in Madagascar again if the captive-bred ducks can be found a new wetland home. ""We have been very successful in establishing a captive population,"" said Dr Hilton. ""And we have recently identified a lake that we think has potential to be restored and become a reintroduction site. ""The main thing we have to do is work with the local people to reintroduce and restore the pochard, but also to restore the lake and help people to get a better livelihood from the lake they live around.""

"(CNN) -- The National Football League has indefinitely suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick without pay, officials with the league said Friday. NFL star Michael Vick is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. ""Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. Your team, the NFL, and NFL fans have all been hurt by your actions,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Vick. Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over. In papers filed Friday with a federal court in Virginia, Vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well. Falcons owner Arthur Blank said Vick's admissions describe actions that are ""incomprehensible and unacceptable."" The suspension makes ""a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the NFL will not be tolerated,"" he said in a statement. Watch what led to Vick's suspension » . Goodell said the Falcons could ""assert any claims or remedies"" to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from the 10-year, $130 million contract he signed in 2004, according to The Associated Press. Vick said he would plead guilty to one count of ""Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture"" in a plea agreement filed at U.S. District Court in Richmond, Virginia. The charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, ""full restitution, a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release,"" the plea deal said. Federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines. ""The defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense,"" the plea agreement said. In an additional summary of facts, signed by Vick and filed with the agreement, Vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs, but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won. ""Most of the 'Bad Newz Kennels' operations and gambling monies were provided by Vick,"" the official summary of facts said. Gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators Tony Taylor, Quanis Phillips and sometimes Purnell Peace, it continued. ""Vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights. Vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by 'Bad Newz Kennels.' "" Vick also agreed that ""collective efforts"" by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs. Around April, Vick, Peace and Phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at Vick's property in Virginia, the statement said. ""Peace, Phillips and Vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in 'testing' sessions at 1915 Moonlight Road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods, including hanging and drowning. ""Vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of Peace, Phillips and Vick,"" the summary said. Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia, already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences. Vick, 27, is scheduled to appear Monday in court, where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge. See a timeline of the case against Vick » . The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement. The federal case against Vick focused on the interstate conspiracy, but Vick's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges, according to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""It sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior,"" Toobin said Friday. ""The risk for Vick is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea, the state of Virginia could say, 'Hey, look, you admitted violating Virginia state law as well. We're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court.' "" In the plea deal, Vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary. Vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests. Vick agreed to ""make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated"" with the dogs that are being held by the government. ""Such costs may include, but are not limited to, all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case, including if necessary, the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals."" Prosecutors, with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs. But the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against Vick and his admitted co-conspirators. Judge Henry E. Hudson issued an order Thursday telling the U.S. Marshals Service to ""arrest and seize the defendant property, and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property."" Both the judge's order and Vick's filing refer to ""approximately"" 53 pit bull dogs. After Vick's indictment last month, Goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the Falcons training camp, and the league is reviewing the case. Blank told the NFL Network on Monday he could not speculate on Vick's future as a Falcon, at least not until he had seen ""a statement of facts"" in the case. E-mail to a friend .

"A State Department spokesman said the election process was flawed and could not be seen as free and fair. He said the Ortega government had side-lined opposition candidates and limited monitoring of the polls. Daniel Ortega won 72.5% of the vote with 99.8% of the ballots counted. His closest rival, centre-right candidate Maximino Rodriguez, only received 14.2% of the vote. The State Department's Mark Toner said the Ortega government had not invited international election observers, which he said, ""further degraded the legitimacy of the election"". ""We continue to press the Nicaraguan government to uphold democratic practices, including press freedom and respect for universal human rights in Nicaragua,"" he added. Mr Ortega had been widely expected to win both due to the popularity of his social programmes and because he faced no obvious political challenger. A former left-wing rebel, Mr Ortega has led Nicaragua through a period of economic stability which has made him popular with the country's business sector and foreign investors. Supporters of Mr Ortega took to the streets to celebrate his victory. But even before the first results were announced, members of the opposition coalition Broad Front for Democracy (FAD) called the elections a ""farce"". The FAD, which had urged voters to boycott the election, alleged that more than 70% had abstained from voting. They were contradicted by the electoral authorities which put voter participation at 65.8%. Mr Ortega's running mate was his wife, Rosario Murillo, who now looks set to become vice-president. Analysts say that Ms Murillo already shares decision-making with Mr Ortega and could become president if her 70-year-old husband were to bow out. Nicaragua's economy has grown at double the Latin American average, but the country still needs to attract more foreign investment. A $50bn (£40bn) plan to build an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua with Chinese investment has gained international attention, but there are serious doubts over whether it will ever be built. The country has been able to avoid the sky-high murder rates of some of its Central American neighbours but it also faces the ever pervasive threat of drug-trafficking.",formal

"Every basic ecology class teaches this. The idea situation would be to harvest and maintain the population when they are at K/2 (half the carrying capacity). This would mean they are experiencing the highest rate of increase. If you keep a population very low (which is usually as, as seen in this article), there will be an large number of small or juvenile fish that aren't participating in reproduction, and there is also a chance of local extinction. Additionally, if you keep the population high (although this never really happens), the rate of increase is greatly reduced due to the population being close to it's carrying capacity - basically wasting potential fish.

"My cousin and I were always competitive battlers, and we'd often battle on firered/leaf green through wireless adaptors. When we weren't battling, we would search for different pokemon to catch for the pokedex and battle with. Well I chose squirtle as my starter, and after a lot of searching and training he reached level 98. I had a rare candy in my bag, so he would've been my first level hundred. That is, of course, if my cousin hadn't been there! He told me that if I raised it to level 100 then he would die and I'd have to say good-bye to him at the pokemon tower in lavender town. That scared the shit out of me! I didn't want to lose that blastoise, so I never used it. Until one day my cousin and I traded game boys for the day and just started messing around with each others. I was tryin to get mewtwo on his, and he was going through the elite 4 on mine. He used blastoise and a bunch of other pokemon, but mostly the blastoise. He leveled up to 99, and then my cousin gave him the rare candy. Level 100. I was scared and nearly shit my pants. My cousin gave me this somber look. I did the only reasonable thing I could think of to save my blastoise. I started over so I didn't have to see him ""die"". Damn it! I miss that guy!

"England made only 134-8 despite being well set on 50-1 after six overs, Jos Buttler top-scoring with 32 not out while spinner Imran Tahir took 4-21. The hosts needed 15 runs from the final over and two off the last delivery. Chris Morris scampered two as bowler Reece Topley failed to collect Joe Root's throw from long-off. Morris, who also produced a match-winning 62 off 38 balls in the fourth one-day international, finished with 17 not out off seven balls. The defeat was England's fourth in a row following their 3-2 reverse in the one-day series, but only their first loss in seven Twenty20 internationals. The second game of the two-match series takes places in Johannesburg on Sunday. That will be England's last competitive match before their opening game of the World Twenty20 on 16 March. England knew they needed wickets to have any chance of winning and their hopes were boosted when Chris Jordan (3-23) dismissed AB de Villiers cheaply and Ben Stokes (1-19) removed Hashim Amla for 22 in a wicket-maiden. Adil Rashid claimed the wicket of JP Duminy and fellow spinner Moeen Ali struck twice, including the wicket of top scorer Faf du Plessis for 25, to make the hosts nervous. David Miller hit a six and a four in the 18th over but Jordan had him caught on the boundary and bowled David Wiese via an inside edge in a superb penultimate over that cost only six runs. After Kyle Abbott ran a single off the first ball of the final over, Morris struck successive full tosses from Topley for four and six. However, a dot ball was followed by two to long-off, leaving Morris on strike for the last delivery of the game. Root's throw on the bounce was accurate but Topley, at the non-striker's end, fumbled the ball with Morris short of his ground. Had Topley completed the run-out, the game would have gone to a super over. Alex Hales helped get England off to a promising start with the bat but became Tahir's first wicket when he was caught for 27, Duminy taking a high catch despite team-mate Kagiso Rabada almost rugby-tackling him in a race for the ball. Three balls later Root fell for eight to Wiese's first delivery and Stokes was stumped off Tahir the ball after hitting a muscular six. Tahir then dismissed Morgan for 10 and Moeen first ball, and came within a whisker of a hat-trick as Jordan was beaten by a googly that went between bat and pad. Helped by the accurate Wiese, who conceded only 19 off four overs, South Africa allowed only one boundary between the start of the eighth over and the end of the 14th. England's 100 came up in 16th over but with Buttler restrained by the circumstances, they were unable to set the total they would have desired. South Africa are now unbeaten in their past 13 matches against England at Newlands - a run that goes back to January 1957. They have won 10 and drawn three matches, having played six Tests, five ODIs and two T20s. England captain Eoin Morgan: ""After a pretty poor batting display our bowlers nearly pulled it out of the bag. ""Stokes and Jordan got as much as they could out of the pitch. The more and more we play the more responsibility the bowlers take on their shoulders. ""We created chances with an under-par score. That is a huge positive. ""We have had a reasonably good run in T20s and probably should have won tonight when we didn't deserve to."" South Africa captain Faf du Plessis: ""That's a massive get-out-of-jail card. ""Neither team played their best because the wicket was two-paced and not a normal T20 wicket, but I have a smile on my face because we won. ""We didn't start well. Twenty20 cricket is all about executing plans and we let them get away at the start. Our bowlers came back by getting wickets. ""We tried to learn from their mistakes - maybe they went a bit hard at the ball - and we tried to play deeper. We messed it up a little but Chris Morris, the million-dollar man, saved us.""",formal

"The title pacesetters would always be able to recover from a bad result - but how would they cope with the exclusion of their firebrand top scorer after a training ground bust-up and suggestions of interest from China? Chelsea gave their answer with an impressive 3-0 win at Leicester City that, combined with the weekend's other results, put them firmly back in control of their Premier League destiny. So, after 21 games and another weekend of significant matches, how are the top six clubs shaping up? Form: Won 14 out of past 15. Upcoming fixtures: 22 January - Hull (home), 31 January - Liverpool (away), 4 February - Arsenal (home). Conte will have demanded an instant Premier League response from his team after that 2-0 loss at White Hart Lane, which he rightly placed in context by pointing out it was inflicted by a quality side with title aspirations of their own. The wildcard was provided by the sudden falling out with influential striker Costa that provided an unexpected backdrop to Saturday's events at the King Power Stadium and gave the first hint of dissent in Chelsea and Conte's camp this season. In the end, the Italian boss was given the opportunity to prove the versatility and flexibility of his squad in Costa's absence as Willian, Eden Hazard and Pedro provided the attacking threat. In the absence of any suggestion Blues owner Roman Abramovich will bow to pressure to sell in January, the priority now is to get the combustible Spain striker back on side and ensure any unrest does not spread. If that can be done, then Chelsea can look back at a weekend where their title position was strengthened as they now stand seven points clear. Verdict: Back on track and clear title favourites. Form: Won past six. Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Manchester City (away), 31 January - Sunderland (away), 4 February - Middlesbrough (home). Mauricio Pochettino's side are a growing force in this title race and the 4-0 demolition of West Bromwich Albion was further evidence of their growing authority. It was their sixth straight league win since their loss at Manchester United in December - and they have only lost two games out of 21. Harry Kane is firing on all cylinders, shown by his hat-trick against West Brom, and with Dele Alli scoring seven goals in his past five league games Spurs are starting to look the full package. They ran out of steam towards the end of last season, but Pochettino is a top-class operator who will surely have learned his lesson and tailored his team's intense style accordingly. The Argentine will still hope to avoid injuries and there is a real worry over influential defender Jan Vertonghen, who Pochettino fears has suffered a ""bad"" ankle injury. Next weekend's game at Manchester City will tell us even more about them. Verdict: Flew under the radar for a while but now right at the heart of the title race. Form: One defeat in past 19. Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Swansea (home), 31 January - Chelsea (home), 4 February - Hull (away). Liverpool will be disappointed they could not hold on for victory at Manchester United on Sunday, but there is plenty of encouragement to take from their performance. The disappointment will come because they were within six minutes of securing a win that would not only have inflicted even more damage on United, but also would have sent a strong message to those nearer the top of the table. It is to the Reds' credit that they came so close to victory despite key men such as Philippe Coutinho still not fit enough to start, Nathaniel Clyne out with a rib injury and Joel Matip sidelined because of confusion surrounding his absence from Cameroon's Africa Cup Of Nations squad. Manager Jurgen Klopp rightly believes they are still in a strong position but will surely be frustrated that Zlatan Ibrahimovic's late goal means Chelsea stretched their advantage to seven points. Verdict: Remain title contenders but top four would still be fine achievement. Form: Unbeaten in past four. Upcoming fixtures: 22 January - Burnley (home), 31 January - Watford (home), 4 February - Chelsea (away). Arsenal's win at Swansea City could not have been more convincing and they have responded well to successive losses at Everton and Manchester City, when they conceded winning positions and showed the vulnerability that has haunted them for seasons. Even at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday they made a slow start, but it is hard to argue with a 4-0 away win. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants the Gunners to stay in the title shake-up until the closing stages - and they are certainly doing that so far. Are they, however, potential Premier League winners? They cannot be ruled out but it is hard to see where they will pick up the points to haul in Chelsea. Verdict: In the mix as their manager demands, but will a soft centre let them down? Form: Two defeats in past three. Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Tottenham (home), 1 February - West Ham (away), 5 February - Swansea (home). Manager Pep Guardiola effectively wrote off Manchester City's title challenge after they were giving a thorough working over and beaten 4-0 at Everton. City now face a fight to finish in the top four with a side seemingly physically weak, riddled with defensive frailty and a goalkeeper in Claudio Bravo who hardly ever seems to save a shot. Failure to make next season's Champions League would represent a catastrophe in the Spaniard's first season. And this is Guardiola's responsibility after he shipped out England keeper Joe Hart on loan to Torino. Out of the past 22 shots Bravo has faced, 14 have been goals. Only five teams have a lower haul than City's tally of four clean sheets and they have conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their past seven games. The problems are there for all to see, although Guardiola has so far done little to correct the faults. City have suffered two damaging defeats on Merseyside in recent weeks - and do not look like a side who have the slightest chance of making up a 10-point deficit on Chelsea. Verdict: Forget the title. Manchester City are in a top-four fight now. Form: Unbeaten in past 12. Upcoming fixtures: 21 January - Stoke (away), 1 February - Hull (home), 5 February - Leicester (away). Manchester United are showing definite signs of improvement under manager Jose Mourinho, but like neighbours City their fight is now for the top four rather than the title. They could have closed to within two points of Liverpool with victory at Old Trafford on Sunday, but 12 points is surely an impossible gap to breach between United and Chelsea. United have drawn seven league games - including five at home - and the simple fact is they have squandered too many points to make up the deficit. Mourinho is definitely moving United forward, but not fast enough to make them title contenders this season. Verdict: Top four should be the target. The title is now out of reach.",formal

Your birth parents called you by a name they chose. However, you would cry out in fear and anger whenever they spoke it. Fear because you were afraid to become attached to the name (and, in turn, the home you were being raised in). Anger, due to the fact that you were upset at your parents for keeping you in a hell-hole such as this.

A person can continue to put on layers and layers of clothes to get warm. However, there are only so many layers of clothes you can take off to cool down though. I would not recommend peeling layers of skin off. Someone once told me I didn't understand, because I've never had to scrape ice off of a car windshield. I have never had to do that, but I have physically injured myself getting into my car in the summer. The door handle is hot, the seats are like fire, and the metal part of the seat belt will literally blister your fingers, or god forbid it touches some mid-drift. Also, there is a complete lack of character in the greater valley's architecture. All the homes are stucco, and they are all the same color. We literally have cookie cutter neighborhoods. All the homes in these very common neighborhoods are EXACTLY the same except a slight difference in shades for the exterior paint. Out Downtown is nice, and has character, but during the day, only a few blocks are active, and same during the night. It's great to look out, but it is not where you want to live. This is known, so the only homes there are shacks filled by meth addicts or illegal immigrants.

"DURBAN, South Africa -- India's Yuvraj Singh smashed six sixes in one over as England crashed out of cricket's World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa on Wednesday. Yuvraj Singh smashes his sixth successive six off England fast bowler Stuart Broad . Paul Collingwood's side were eliminated at the Super Eights stage after South Africa earlier beat New Zealand by six wickets in Durban. England then lost by 18 runs to the Singh-inspired Indians, who kept their semifinal hopes alive ahead of Thursday's must-win clash with the hosts. Singh reached the fastest 50 in Twenty20 history, needing just 12 deliveries, as India made 218-4. The left-hander's six consecutive sixes in the 19th over bowled by Stuart Broad made him the first player to do so in Twenty20 matches and just the fourth in all senior cricket. South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs performed the feat at the 50-over World Cup in the West Indies earlier this year, while Sir Garfield Sobers and Ravi Shastri achieved it in first-class matches. Singh's innings ended on 58 -- from 16 balls -- when he hit a full-toss from Andrew Flintoff to captain Collingwood at long-on from the penultimate delivery of the final over, in which he also cleared the boundary ropes once. Virender Sehwag top-scored with 68 off 52 balls, putting on 136 for the first wicket with Gautam Gambhir, who hit 58 off 41 deliveries. Broad ended with the embarrassing figures of 0-60 off his four overs, while fellow seamer Chris Tremlett took 2-45. In reply, England battled gamely but could only post 200-6 in their 20 overs. Opener Vikram Solanki top-scored with 43 off 31 balls, and Kevin Pietersen hit 39 off 23 deliveries, but no-one could match the fireworks provided by Singh. Left-arm seamer Irfan Pathan claimed figures of 3-37 off four overs, while Rudra Pratap Singh took 2-28. If India can beat South Africa, it would create a three-way tie and require net run-rates to decide the two teams going through. The Proteas have two wins from two Group E outings after beating New Zealand, who have completed their Super Eights fixtures with two victories and a defeat. South Africa restricted the Black Caps to 153-8 from their 20 overs on Wednesday, then reached the target with five deliveries to spare as Justin Kemp made an unbeaten 89. Kemp was named man of the match after smashing a six off the otherwise economical Mark Gillespie for the winning runs. He belted six sixes and six fours in his 56-ball innings, having come to the crease in the fourth over with South Africa reeling at 17-2. Kemp added 28 in four overs with Gibbs (19) before putting on another 65 in eight overs with Mark Boucher. Boucher departed for 23, caught by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum off Gillespie, who ended with figures of 2-11 off 3.1 overs. The experienced Shaun Pollock then joined Kemp, and struck one six in his unbeaten 16 off 11 deliveries to help guide the Proteas to their second victory. The in-form Craig McMillan top-scored for the Kiwis, hitting an unbeaten 48 off only 25 balls to follow up his blistering 57 in Tuesday's five-run win against England. McCullum had put on 68 for the first wicket with Lou Vincent, scoring 38 before becoming the first of Morne Morkel's four victims. Morkel, who ended with figures of 4-17 off four overs, then removed Ross Taylor (1) two runs later and later bowled the dangerous Jacob Oram for a quickfire 15. He had Shane Bond caught by Boucher, and then almost became the first Twenty20 bowler to claim five wickets when his penultimate delivery -- which clean bowled Gillespie -- was declared a no-ball by umpire Billy Doctrove.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House is blasting Congressional Democrats for not sending a bill that would fund veterans' care programs to the president's desk by Veterans Day. The White House's Dana Perino accused Democrats of holding veterans care funding hostage. ""There's absolutely no reason that the veterans' bill could not have been signed by the president today, except for the political games that the Democrats decided to play with it,"" White House press secretary Dana Perino said Sunday in Crawford, Texas. Congressional Democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities, including health, labor and education. Democrats also added $3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs. The labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $10 billion over last year's funding for those programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending. The House passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached, but the Senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president. Perino accused the Democrats of ""trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes."" ""The president wants clean legislation, a clean bill to fund the veterans,"" Perino said. On Saturday, the Democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to President Bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending, sayings disagreements over funding levels ""have never been so great that we cannot reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the American people."" ""Key to this dialogue, however, is some willingness on your part to actually find common ground,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in the letter. The leadership said last year's Congress, which was still under Republican control, had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs. Congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through December 14, the leadership said. The current funding level ""is still below the $3.9 billion extra that we passed,"" said Nadeam Elshami, spokesman Pelosi. ""We are committed to getting the extra funding that the Congress already voted on the president's desk for his signature."" The leadership blamed Republican members of Congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill. Perino, though, said the Democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of Congress. ""The Democrats decided not to send the president this bill,"" Perino said. ""That has to be laid at their feet."" E-mail to a friend . CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",formal

Men were sweating profusely, women were crying. ""There was fear on their faces,"" Pelser said. ""Everyone started panicking."" But the pilot of Nationwide Airlines' Boeing 737 Flight CE723 was able to fly long enough to dump fuel and make an emergency landing at Cape Town International Airport. Including crew, 100 hundred people were on the plane that departed at 3:50 p.m. on an hourlong flight to Johannesburg, South Africa. No one was injured. The jet had only been in the air about 10 minutes before the engine fell. ""We heard something crash and bang, the plane veering left and right. A person on the right side said the engine was missing -- had broken clean off,"" said Pelser. Watch Pelser describe how the flight crew told passengers to ""prepare for the worst"" » . ""They flew us in very slowly. We were all prepared for the worst. We went into the fetal position, head between the legs,"" he said. ""Then we hit the runway."" ""I did kind of pray. I didn't want to die. I'm not really ready to die,"" the 33-year-old said. An object had been sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground and officials are trying to identify it. The engine-to-wing supporting structure is designed to release an engine ""when extreme forces are applied,"" to prevent structural damage to the wing, Nationwide said on its Web site. The airline described the incident as a ""catastrophic engine failure."" As the nose wheel lifted from the ground, ""the captain heard a loud noise immediately followed by a yaw of the aircraft (sideways slippage) to the right,"" the airline said in a news release. The flight instruments showed the No. 2 engine on the right side had failed, it said. Pelser said he spent the night in Cape Town, then flew back to Johannesburg where he lives, on the same airline. Nationwide said the engine had undergone a major overhaul in March 2005 at ""an approved Federal Aviation Authority facility in the U.S.A."" and had flown only 3,806 hours since then. ""These engines typically achieve 10,000 hours between major overhauls,"" Nationwide Airlines' press release stated. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"As the saying goes, ""Good artists create, great artists steal."" The only real problems are if anyone else has played the game before, and therefore knows what's going to happen, and if they decide to go off the rails. Remember, the great strength of pen and paper RPGs is that they're freeform. Unfortunately, that's the exact opposite of the great strength of published stories, namely that they're completed. Regular authors don't have to worry about one of their characters suddenly deciding to derail the plot, because they control everyone. You don't have that luxury. What will you do if they decide to side with the bad guy? Will it be an insurmountable campaign-killer if they decide to refuse a job? What happens if they murder an important NPC?

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some Democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious House resolution labeling Turkey's treatment of Armenians in World War I as genocide. A KC-135 tanker lands at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey in 2003. Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally and NATO partner, was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide and threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the strategically important Incirlik, military officials said Tuesday. Ankara acknowledges the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently objects to the ""genocide"" label. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. But the Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue, and some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. ""I said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here,"" said Hoyer of Maryland. ""I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions. We will have to determine where everybody is."" Democratic Rep. Ike Skelton, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, announced his opposition to the resolution last week. And Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings of Florida and John Tanner of Tennessee, both members of the U.S. House delegation to NATO, urged Pelosi to reconsider in a letter released Tuesday. ""More than half of the cargo flown into Iraq and Afghanistan comes through Incirlik Air Base, and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future,"" they wrote. Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Pentagon planners are looking at ""a broad range of options"" to keep food, fuel and ammunition flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq if Turkey blocks Incirlik. ""We're confident that we'll find ways to do that,"" Ham told reporters at the Pentagon. ""There's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that, and obviously we'd prefer to maintain the access that we have."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed lawmakers' concerns last week. ""About 70 percent of all air cargo going into Iraq goes through Turkey. ... About a third of the fuel that they consume goes through Turkey or comes from Turkey,"" Gates said. He also said that 95 percent of the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protective vehicles, or MRAPs, being deployed in Iraq are flown through Turkey. The vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs. See Incirlik's key location » . The U.S. military issued a ""warning order"" a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews, planes, fuel and routes are lined up if Turkey stops or restricts U.S. access to Incirlik, a source said. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives the United States is considering. Some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the Turks to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq which could further complicate Iraqi stability, U.S. officials said. Incirlik offers 10,000- and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters, according Globalsecurity.org, a source of background information about military issues. Globalsecurity said Incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to Iraq, taking over for Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany because it is closer to Iraq, reducing the strain on troops and aircraft.

"(LiveWire) -- Voluble Gary Vaynerchuk, 31, the host of ""Wine Library TV,"" an online video show, has been known to lick rocks, suck leather and eat dirt while on camera, all to illustrate the unique properties of wine. ""Wine Library TV"" host Gary Vaynerchuk discusses four spooky wine varieties for Halloween show. Of a ""wild and gamey"" red from Rioja, Spain, Vaynerchuk says, ""Hit a deer on the road. Throw a bunch of cherries on it. Take out your knife, cut the deer. Bite it. That's the flavor profile."" That kind of attitude appeals to people who are mystified by the arcane lexicon of traditional wine journals or turned off by what they perceive as elitist barriers. Across the Internet, budding wine geeks are discovering a burgeoning number of Web sites, blogs, bulletin boards and other outlets that preach the gospel of the grape in terms they can understand. About 40,000 Internet viewers -- many of them 20-somethings -- have a daily appointment with ""Wine Library TV."" The low-budget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the three-level wine retail operation that Vaynerchuk's family owns in Springfield, New Jersey. Vaynerchuk has a discerning nose and palate, and he doesn't dumb down his subject. Yet he stuffs his patter with sports and pop-culture references -- and the kind of language a Wine Spectator critic would be unlikely to employ. The mission of wine sites like ""Wine Library TV,"" say several of the people behind these new outlets, is to demystify wine (and in some cases, sell it, too). Using the language, attitude and new media that appeal to a young, tech-savvy generation, they advocate trusting one's own palate rather than obeying powerful wine critics. Some of the sites also provide opportunities for average wine drinkers to share their opinions. One site, SavorEachGlass.com, declares its dedication to ""exploring the spirit of wine for a new generation,"" with reviews, online journals and essays that explain the finer points of winemaking -- all with attitude. ""The (wine) establishment is about ratings and 'reputation,'"" says the site's founder, Tynan Szvetecz, 29. ""It's about collecting the 'good' stuff as defined by someone else's palate and tastes. That bores a younger generation."" ""We're not afraid to be smartasses,"" he continues. ""We make fun of ourselves, old-world wine makers, new-world wine makers, and anyone else we can get our hands on."" In the U.S., interest in wine is exploding. While consumption has leveled out in traditional wine-producing countries such as France, Italy and Spain, especially among young people, it has trended upwards in the U.S. for 15 straight years. The U.S. is projected to overtake No. 2 Italy by the end of 2007, according to the annual report The U.S. Wine Market: Impact Databank Review and Forecast a leading industry trade publication. Many of the new converts to wine are the so-called Millennials, the under-30 age group coveted by beverage marketers and so comfortable online that they're also called iGen, or the Internet Generation. One of the wine Web sites targeting a younger demographic is VineSugar.com, which features a blog called ""Wine Burps."" ""We love wine but hate the elitism,"" writes founder, Ryan O'Donnell. ""After all, it's just grape juice."" With rants about wine tasting fees, a feature spotlighting ""wine hotties"" working at California wineries, as well as interactive maps that plot and rate wineries, VineSugar.com leaves little doubt about its target audience. CellarTracker.com, an online wine community, appeals to more established wine collectors. The site provides free software -- designed by Eric LeVine, a fortuitously named former Microsoft software developer -- that allows wine enthusiasts to create an online inventory of their wines. The 39,000 users (who count 6 million bottles in their virtual cellars) post reviews of their wines and access scores and other data via PDAs and cell phones. Community tasting notes shed light on how cellar-worthy wines are evolving, helping others decide when to crack open a treasured bottle. Corkd.com, another online community of wine fans, already had 40,000 users when Vaynerchuk purchased the site last year. The free service allows users to catalog and review wines. Instead of having ""friends"" as on Facebook, members identify ""drinking buddies"" and check out what they're drinking. In the growing presence of wine fans on the Internet -- newbies as well as connoisseurs -- Vaynerchuk sees a movement. ""They're part of forums, they meet up (offline),"" he says. ""It's about bringing people together. It's all that's right about wine."" Vaynerchuk should know. The 300-plus shows he has taped in the past two years have developed a cult following of online fans, who call themselves ""Vayniacs,"" share wine tips and obsess about their hero on the site's forum. On a recent rainy afternoon, Vaynerchuk barreled, unrehearsed and unscripted, through a 20-minute show in a single take. He wrapped up Wine Library TV episode No. 337 with what has become his signature line. ""You, with a little bit of me, we're changing the wine world, aren't we?"" E-mail to a friend .

"Governments have agreed to keep the global temperature rise to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - and preferably 1.5 degrees. ""This is a moment to celebrate,"" United Nations climate chief Patricia Espinosa told Reuters. ""It is also a moment to look ahead with sober assessment and renewed will over the task ahead."" The Eiffel Tower in Paris is expected to be lit up in green light on Friday to mark the entry into force of the historic climate pact. Delegates from almost 200 countries are meeting in Marrakech next week to consider the way ahead beyond Paris. The deal agreed in the French capital less than a year ago commits governments to moving their economies away from fossil fuels. On Thursday, a UN review of national pledges to cut carbon said they fall short of the levels needed to keep the rise in global temperatures under 2C. The report found pledges from governments that have ratified the accord would see the world on track for a rise in temperatures by the end of this century of between 2.9 and 3.4 degrees C. Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst The Paris climate pact comes into force less than a year since it was agreed. The last major climate deal - the Kyoto Protocol - took eight years to come into force. Paris is the first agreement tying rich and poor nations in a common endeavour to protect the climate. However, the national targets for cutting carbon emissions are voluntary. The UN tried a mandatory approach but countries that were failing to meet their targets simply quit. The process of the Paris deal is binding, including a commitment for governments to keep returning to the issue to ratchet up the clean energy targets that they all agree are inadequate. Governments that rushed to enshrine Paris in law have had one eye on the US elections. Hilary Clinton has pledged to take President Obama's emissions cuts further. Donald Trump wants to tear up the agreement. Environmental groups and other experts have urged governments to do more. World Bank group president Jim Yong Kim said even with the commitments made in Paris and encouraging action on the ground, ""we will not meet our aspiration of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees unless we move faster and at the scale that is needed"". ""As the world heads into (the meeting) in Marrakesh, we must regain the sense of urgency we felt a year ago,"" he said. In Marrakech governments and parties will work on details of a ""rulebook"" which will measure and review global climate action. What was agreed in Paris? • To peak greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and achieve a balance between sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century • To keep global temperature increase ""well below"" 2C (3.6F) and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C • To review progress every five years • $100 billion a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, with a commitment to further finance in the future. Donald Trump has called manmade climate change ""a hoax"" and said he would ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement and other international efforts to address the issue. He says he supports clean water and air, but wants to slash funding to the Environmental Protection Agency in the US. Hillary Clinton backs the Paris deal, saying climate change is a threat to American security. She supports stringent regulation of the energy industry and opposes expanded drilling in Alaska, but has not made the environment a central part of her campaign.

"(CNN) -- At one point in Jared Hutchins' young life, the Beatles were a big problem. The rallies, which draw mostly teens, are one part concert, one part Christian revival. ""I had to stop listening to them for a while,"" said Hutchins, who lives in Cumming, Georgia, and plays the piano, guitar and harmonica. He said the group's world view ""had a negative effect on me,"" and made him irritable and angry. ""God owns my life, not the Beatles,"" he said simply. Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles. Hutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him. Last year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said. Acquire the Fire -- regional rallies held across the country -- and BattleCry -- the larger rallies held this year in only three cities -- are the products of the evangelical Christian organization Teen Mania. Go behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a BattleCry event » . One part concert, one part Christian revival, the rallies seek to ""stage a reverse revolution"" against secular popular culture. They have the pull of headlining rock concerts, drawing thousands of people regardless of the region of the country, the month of year or the day of the week. The audiences are nearly always predominantly teenagers and young adults. From 2006 to 2007, a total of 127,830 people attended the 34 Acquire the Fire rallies, and 71,414 people attended the three BattleCry events held in San Francisco, California; Detroit, Michigan; and Bristow, Virginia, according to Teen Mania. Watch flags, fireworks and teens at rally . For Hutchins, who said he struggled in his early adolescence to fit in and be cool before having a personal experience with God about four years ago, the organization's message is exactly right. ""We don't have to be branded by the culture, we are branded by God,"" he said. ""Be who God created you to be."" But the glossy, glamorous appeal of popular culture too often obscures that path to God, Teen Mania followers say. And so, Ron Luce, the 46-year-old founder of the organization, has waged a modern-day crusade against ""purveyors of popular culture,"" whom he has condemned as ""the enemy."" More than two decades old, Teen Mania estimates it has reached more than 2 million teens with its message ""of living completely for Christ."" The organization is sprawling. In addition to its live stadium rallies, there are BattleCry shirts and hats, mobile screen savers, books and a television program. There are international mission trips -- Hutchins attended one in Tijuana, Mexico, this summer. There is even a Teen Mania internship, a one-year program called the Honor Academy, based in Lindale, Texas. In the live events, Luce couples the earnest appeal of a young father with a preacher's ability to mobilize a crowd. He weaves disturbing statistics about teenagers amid his gospel. Today's teenagers are in crisis, he says. ""We're fighting for those who don't know they have a voice, that are being manipulated by our pop culture indulging in things that, really, they're not mature enough to be thinking about yet,"" Luce told CNN. ""Kids are hurting,"" he said. And of those who he feels inflict these moral wounds, Luce said, ""We call them terrorists, virtue terrorists, that are destroying our kids."" ""They're raping virgin teenage America on the sidewalk, and everybody's walking by and acting like everything's OK. And it's just not OK."" To some, Luce's rhetoric is off-putting, hateful and divisive. Opponents point to his views on homosexuality -- not ""in God's plan"" -- and abortion -- the ""ending of a precious life"" -- and say Luce is imposing conservative values on vulnerable teenagers. Explore Americans' views on religion . It is this criticism that Luce and his followers confronted head-on in March at BattleCry San Francisco. There, in arguably the most liberal city in the United States, protesters, armed with megaphones and poster board signs, rallied against BattleCry on the steps of City Hall as the Christian teenagers circled and prayed in a demonstration of their own. ""Ron Luce is a liar!"" one protester shouted. ""Let me hear you say Christian fascist,"" another yelled. Luce and the youths, some as young as 11, also raised their voices. ""God, I ask that as we do this BattleCry, Lord, that you would reveal yourself to the teenagers, God, here, God,"" Mindy Peterson, shouted. Peterson is a member of Teen Mania's Honor Academy. Afterward, Peterson railed against what she said was the protesters' mischaracterization of BattleCry. ""These people think that our war is against other people. They think that our war is against man. And our war isn't. Our war's against ... the pain in teenagers' hearts, like depression, alcoholism. Those things that -- that are, like, tearing our teenagers apart,"" she said. While much milder in his terms, Hutchins agrees. ""We're a generation that is kind of troubled,"" he said. Luce wants to ""rescue the hearts of our generation,"" he added. And of the critics' contention that the rallies, the organization, the message is neo-conservatism wrapped in Biblical verse? Hutchins smiles, nods patiently. ""I don't go because I have a political agenda,"" he said, adding that his friends don't, either. ""Mostly, what we're concerned with is Jesus."" E-mail to a friend .

"Internet searches from the week before the crash were found on the tablet computer used by Andreas Lubitz, Meanwhile, the second ""black box"" flight recorder from the plane has been recovered. There were no survivors among the 150 people on board the A320 on 24 March. The German prosecutors said internet searches made on the tablet found in Lubitz's Duesseldorf flat included ""ways to commit suicide"" and ""cockpit doors and their security provisions"". Spokesman Ralf Herrenbrueck said: ""He concerned himself on one hand with medical treatment methods, on the other hand with types and ways of going about a suicide. ""In addition, on at least one day he concerned himself with search terms about cockpit doors and their security precautions.'' Prosecutors did not disclose the individual search terms in the browser history but said personal correspondence supported the conclusion Lubitz used the device in the period from 16 to 23 March. Lubitz, 27, had been deemed fit to fly by his employers at Germanwings, a subsidiary of Lufthansa. The first ""black box"", the voice recorder, was recovered almost immediately at the crash site. Based on that evidence, investigators said they believed Lubitz intentionally crashed Flight 9525, which was travelling from Barcelona to Duesseldorf, taking control of the aircraft while the pilot was locked out of the cockpit. The second ""black box"" recovered is the flight data recorder (FDR) which should hold technical information on the time of radio transmissions and the plane's acceleration, airspeed, altitude and direction, plus the use of auto-pilot. At a press conference, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said there was ""reasonable hope"" the recorder which was being sent to Paris for examination, would provide useful information. The ""completely blackened"" equipment was found near a ravine and was not discovered immediately because it was the same colour as the rocks, he said. He said: ""The second black box is an indispensable addition to understand what happened especially in the final moment of the flight."" He told the media 150 separate DNA profiles had been isolated from the crash site but he stressed that did not mean all the victims had been identified. As each DNA set is matched to a victim, families will be notified immediately, he said, He added 40 mobile phones had been recovered. He said they would be analysed in a laboratory but were ""heavily damaged"". Also on Thursday, Germanwings said it was unaware that Lubitz had experienced depression while he was training to be a pilot. Lufthansa confirmed on Tuesday that it knew six years ago that the co-pilot had suffered from an episode of ""severe depression'' before he finished his flight training. ``We didn't know this,'' said Vanessa Torres, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings, which hired Lubitz in September 2013. She could not explain why Germanwings had not been informed. The final minutes Lubitz began the jet's descent at 10:31 (09:31 GMT) on 24 March, shortly after the A320 had made its final contact with air traffic control.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 447/98(4)of 1 March 1998 on the notifications, time-limits and hearings provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 must be modified in order to take account of those amendments. For the sake of clarity it should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new regulation. (3) The Commission has adopted measures concerning the terms of reference of hearing officers in certain competition proceedings. (4) Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 is based on the principle of compulsory notification of concentrations before they are put into effect. On the one hand, a notification has important legal consequences which are favourable to the parties to the proposed concentration, while, on the other hand, failure to comply with the obligation to notify renders the parties liable to fines and may also entail civil law disadvantages for them. It is therefore necessary in the interests of legal certainty to define precisely the subject matter and content of the information to be provided in the notification. (5) It is for the notifying parties to make a full and honest disclosure to the Commission of the facts and circumstances which are relevant for taking a decision on the notified concentration. (6) Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 also allows the undertakings concerned to request, in a reasoned submission, prior to notification, that a concentration fulfilling the requirements of that Regulation be referred to the Commission by one or more Member States, or referred by the Commission to one or more Member States, as the case may be. It is important to provide the Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States concerned with sufficient information, in order to enable them to assess, within a short period of time, whether or not a referral ought to be made. To that end, the reasoned submission requesting the referral should contain certain specific information. (7) In order to simplify and expedite examination of notifications and of reasoned submissions, it is desirable to prescribe that forms be used. (8) Since notification sets in motion legal time-limits pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 139/2004, the conditions governing such time-limits and the time when they become effective should also be determined. (9) Rules must be laid down in the interests of legal certainty for calculating the time-limits provided for in Regulation (EC) No 139/2004. In particular, the beginning and end of time periods and the circumstances suspending the running of such periods must be determined, with due regard to the requirements resulting from the exceptionally tight legal timeframe available for the proceedings. (10) The provisions relating to the Commission's procedure must be framed in such a way as to safeguard fully the right to be heard and the rights of defence. For these purposes, the Commission should distinguish between the parties who notify the concentration, other parties involved in the proposed concentration, third parties and parties regarding whom the Commission intends to take a decision imposing a fine or periodic penalty payments. (11) The Commission should give the notifying parties and other parties involved in the proposed concentration, if they so request, an opportunity before notification to discuss the intended concentration informally and in strict confidence. In addition, the Commission should, after notification, maintain close contact with those parties, to the extent necessary to discuss with them any practical or legal problems which it discovers on a first examination of the case, with a view, if possible, to resolving such problems by mutual agreement. (12) In accordance with the principle of respect for the rights of defence, the notifying parties must be given the opportunity to submit their comments on all the objections which the Commission proposes to take into account in its decisions. The other parties involved in the proposed concentration should also be informed of the Commission's objections and should be granted the opportunity to express their views. (13) Third parties demonstrating a sufficient interest must also be given the opportunity of expressing their views, if they make a written application to that effect. (14) The various persons entitled to submit comments should do so in writing, both in their own interests and in the interests of sound administration, without prejudice to their right to request a formal oral hearing, where appropriate, to supplement the written procedure. In urgent cases, however, the Commission must be enabled to proceed immediately to formal oral hearings of the notifying parties, of other parties involved or of third parties. (15) It is necessary to define the rights of persons who are to be heard, to what extent they should be granted access to the Commission's file and on what conditions they may be represented or assisted. (16) When granting access to the file, the Commission should ensure the protection of business secrets and other confidential information. The Commission should be able to ask undertakings that have submitted documents or statements to identify confidential information. (17) In order to enable the Commission to carry out a proper assessment of commitments offered by the notifying parties with a view to rendering the concentration compatible with the common market, and to ensure due consultation with other parties involved, with third parties and with the authorities of the Member States as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 139/2004, in particular Article 18(1), 18(4), Article 19(1), 19(2), 19(3) and 19(5) thereof, the procedure and time-limits for submitting the commitments referred to in Article 6(2) and Article 8(2) of that Regulation should be laid down. (18) It is also necessary to define the rules applicable to certain time limits set by the Commission. (19) The Advisory Committee on Concentrations must deliver its opinion on the basis of a preliminary draft decision. It must therefore be consulted on a case after the inquiry in to that case has been completed. Such consultation does not, however, prevent the Commission from reopening an inquiry if need be. HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER I SCOPE Article 1 Scope This Regulation shall apply to the control of concentrations conducted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 139/2004. CHAPTER II NOTIFICATIONS AND OTHER SUBMISSIONS Article 2 Persons entitled to submit notifications 1.

Joint notifications shall be submitted on a single form. 2. One original and 35 copies of the Form CO and the supporting documents shall be submitted to the Commission. The notification shall be delivered to the address referred to in Article 23(1) and in the format specified by the Commission. 3. The supporting documents shall be either originals or copies of the originals; in the latter case the notifying parties shall confirm that they are true and complete. 4. Notifications shall be in one of the official languages of the Community. For the notifying parties, this language shall also be the language of the proceeding, as well as that of any subsequent proceedings relating to the same concentration. Supporting documents shall be submitted in their original language. Where the original language is not one of the official languages of the Community, a translation into the language of the proceeding shall be attached. 5. Where notifications are made pursuant to Article 57 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, they may also be submitted in one of the official languages of the EFTA States or the working language of the EFTA Surveillance Authority. If the language chosen for the notifications is not an official language of the Community, the notifying parties shall simultaneously supplement all documentation with a translation into an official language of the Community. The language which is chosen for the translation shall determine the language used by the Commission as the language of the proceeding for the notifying parties. Article 4 Information and documents to be provided 1. Notifications shall contain the information, including documents, requested in the applicable forms set out in the Annexes. The information shall be correct and complete. 2. The Commission may dispense with the obligation to provide any particular information in the notification, including documents, or with any other requirement specified in Annexes I and II where the Commission considers that compliance with those obligations or requirements is not necessary for the examination of the case. 3. The Commission shall without delay acknowledge in writing to the notifying parties or their representatives receipt of the notification and of any reply to a letter sent by the Commission pursuant to Article 5(2) and 5(3). Article 5 Effective date of notification 1. Subject to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, notifications shall become effective on the date on which they are received by the Commission. 2. Where the information, including documents, contained in the notification is incomplete in any material respect, the Commission shall inform the notifying parties or their representatives in writing without delay. In such cases, the notification shall become effective on the date on which the complete information is received by the Commission. 3. Material changes in the facts contained in the notification coming to light subsequent to the notification which the notifying parties know or ought to know, or any new information coming to light subsequent to the notification which the parties know or ought to know and which would have had to be notified if known at the time of notification, shall be communicated to the Commission without delay. In such cases, when these material changes or new information could have a significant effect on the appraisal of the concentration, the notification may be considered by the Commission as becoming effective on the date on which the relevant information is received by the Commission; the Commission shall inform the notifying parties or their representatives of this in writing and without delay. 4. Incorrect or misleading information shall be considered to be incomplete information. 5. When the Commission publishes the fact of the notification pursuant to Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004, it shall specify the date upon which the notification has been received. Where, further to the application of paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article, the effective date of notification is later than the date specified in that publication, the Commission shall issue a further publication in which it shall state the later date.

"The Bacc was introduced about a decade ago to offer a more rounded education. Researchers at Cardiff University found students were 15% less likely to achieve a first or 2:1 degree. The Welsh government said the Bacc will be more rigorous from September 2015, and it will address many findings in the report, which it commissioned. The Welsh Bacc brings together traditional qualifications like GCSEs and A-levels with the Bacc ""core,"" comprised of a range of modules including team enterprise activities, community participation and Wales' place in Europe and the world. There are currently more than 78,000 learners registered on Welsh Baccalaureate courses studying at more than 250 schools and other institutions. ""Participation and progress are kind of connected,"" Prof Chris Taylor from Cardiff University, a co-author of the report, told BBC Radio Wales. ""On the one hand you'll find that students are significantly more likely to get into university with the Welsh Baccalaureate. Crucially, they are more likely to get into a leading Russell Group university, which is very good news. ""However that seems to come at the expense then in terms of their successes of degree outcomes. ""Although we find significant results, it does appear that students without the Welsh Baccalaureate are more likely to get a first or a 2:1."" He added: ""The number of students who are not likely to get a good degree isn't as significantly as large as we first thought."" Prof Taylor said the Welsh Bacc's success in terms of getting students into university ""far outweighs"" the disadvantages found in terms of their results. But he said: ""We do make the recommendation that it could be more challenging. It could be more tailored to the particular needs of the students in terms of their choice of subjects at university they're going to study. ""We also recognise there needs to be greater support for the qualification because it has some added value. ""There are clearly some benefits to some students in terms of essay writing skills, in terms of time management and independent learning that most other qualifications don't offer. ""But it doesn't translate in terms of degree results and that may be because it's at the expense of subject knowledge which is missing."" ""On the one hand it's a core qualification that every student should undertake and it provides a set of core skills that everybody like employers, labour markets and higher education universities can understand is there but at the same time it's got to be challenging, got to be tailored to the individual needs of students. ""That challenge is very difficult for sixth forms and FE colleges."" Last year, a study by the Welsh Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD) also suggested undergraduates completing the Welsh Bacc fare less well at university than those who have not. The Welsh government said the research by Cardiff University was commissioned to help with the development of the Welsh Bacc. A spokesperson added: ""Our independent review of qualifications addressed many of the findings in the WISERD report, and we are already taking action to deliver the review's recommendations regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate. ""As a result, we are working towards delivering a more rigorous Welsh Baccalaureate to be taught from September 2015.

"SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Conditions that created what California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger dubbed ""the perfect storm for fire"" eased Wednesday, helping firefighters gain ground against devastating Southern California wildfires. A plane drops fire retardant on the fourth day of a wildfire pushed by winds through Pauma Valley, California. Winds that gusted as much as 101 mph on Sunday dropped to about 30 mph Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, the dry Santa Ana winds that have fanned the flames, changed direction and began blowing inland from the Pacific Ocean, increasing the humidity and easing the burden on almost 8,900 firefighters in the area. But the destruction was taking its toll on the men and women on the front lines of the fires. ""It hurts us to have those homes lost. It hurts us to have those injuries. And it is frustrating for us to watch our community be devastated by this,"" said firefighter Andy Menshek. As conditions improved, officials allowed people to return to communities that had been off-limits because of intense flames and dense smoke. ""It was home,"" said Mark Davis, whose two-story Rancho Bernardo house burned to the ground. ""It was us. We had been there 28 years, and it had a lot of our flavor."" The change in the weather also meant that firefighting aircraft -- grounded for most of the week by the winds -- could finally fly. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Capt. Scott McLean called the droning sound of aircraft the ""sound of joy."" ""Their drops are hitting their mark because the wind is not there,"" he said. The rate of burning had slowed significantly by Wednesday. Still, the fire damage increased to 434,543 acres, said Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Watch Schwarzenegger give a progress report » . That amounted to 679 square miles, or about 10 times the size of Washington, D.C. By Wednesday evening, the largest fire -- the Witch in northern San Diego County -- was 10 percent contained. It burned about 196,000 acres before combining with the smaller Poomacha blaze. Seven fires among the 22 counted Wednesday were contained. See where the fires are burning » . Others, such as the Buckweed Fire in Los Angeles County, were as much as 94 percent contained. One large fire was a suspected arson. The FBI and the Orange County Fire Authority are investigating the Santiago fire that has burned more than 19,000 acres. All three of its points of origin have been declared crime scenes, said Jim Amornino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. A $70,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to the arrest of those responsible for setting the fire. The blaze was about 50 percent contained after destroying 17 structures. Watch the raging flames of the Santiago fire » . The smaller Rosa fire in Riverside County, 70 percent contained at just over 400 acres, was also a probably arson, state officials said. As the fire danger eased, residents were allowed to return to several neighborhoods surrounding San Diego: Del Mar Highlands, Encinitas, Solana Beach, Carmel Valley, Chula Vista and Otay Mesa. Helicopters were back in the air over the Lake Arrowhead, California, area after all air activity had been suspended because of extremely smoky skies. In nearby Running Springs, CNN's Ted Rowlands stood in the midst of charred, smoldering rubble strewn with potentially deadly power lines. ""It will be a while before these people will come back. When they do come back, unfortunately they'll have this pretty much to look at,"" he said Wednesday. Watch Rowlands describe a major battle with the flames » . About 500 homes were lost in the mountainous region in San Bernardino County east of Los Angeles. See photos of the fires » . ""Yesterday we couldn't be here, because just this little flame and smoldering pieces of wood would be thrown by the intense winds. ... Now you can see the flames just basically burning themselves out,"" said Rowlands. The fires have already destroyed 1,664 structures -- including 1,436 homes -- and they still threaten 25,000 more, Schwarzenegger said Wednesday. The blazes have killed three people and left 40 hurt, he said. The governor will fly over the area Thursday with President Bush, who signed a major disaster declaration Wednesday. Watch Bush emphasize the need to be responsive » . It'll speed federal dollars to people whose property losses aren't covered by insurance and will help local and state agencies pay for the emergency response. The cost of homes destroyed by the wildfires is likely to top $1 billion in San Diego County alone, an emergency official said. Federal help keeps arriving as officials promise a response based on lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina. People left homeless by the fires can go online to apply for federal help at FEMA.gov, he said. There were 76,000 people staying in the 42 shelters opened in San Diego County Wednesday morning, according to San Diego emergency spokeswoman Lynda Pfieffer.

"(CNN) -- President Bush blasted the Democratic-controlled Congress on Tuesday for having ""the worst record in 20 years."" ""Congress is not getting its work done,"" Bush said, flanked by members of the Republican House leadership. ""The House of Representatives has wasted valuable time on a constant stream of investigations, and the Senate has wasted valuable time on an endless series of failed votes to pull our troops out of Iraq."" Bush criticized Congress for not being able to send ""a single appropriations bill"" to him. ""They haven't seen a bill they could not solve without shoving a tax hike into it,"" he said. Democrats quickly fired back. Jim Manley, senior aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, said, ""Taking advice from President Bush about fiscal responsibility and getting things done for the American people is like taking hunting lessons from Dick Cheney. Neither is a very good idea."" Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Illinois, issued a statement saying, ""President Bush's rally this morning reminds us that congressional Republicans remain ready and willing to rubber-stamp the Bush agenda: No to children's health care; no to a new direction in Iraq; and no to investing in America's future. The White House and congressional Republicans want to continue the status quo."" Bush said the Senate was ""wasting valuable time"" by taking up the children's health insurance bill, which he had earlier vetoed. Watch Bush describe what he thinks Congress is doing wrong » . House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, issued a statement calling Bush ""the biggest obstacle"" to extending health coverage to ""10 million low-income, working-class American children."" Hoyer said GOP House leaders need to ""stop posing for pictures, and sit down with Democrats and Republicans in Congress who are working together to extend coverage to our children."" The State Children's Health Insurance Program measure passed in the House last week would expand the program by nearly $35 billion over five years, the same as the measure Bush vetoed on October 3. Bush had proposed adding $5 billion to the program, and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program. Democratic leaders said the new version addresses Republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving SCHIP benefits; capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program; and preventing adults from receiving benefits. The program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor, but who can't afford private insurance. Democrats want to extend the program to another 4 million, paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes. Bush said Congress knows the current version of the children's health bill ""does not have a chance,"" to get enough votes to override another veto. Hoyer accused Bush of breaking a promise he made in 2004 to extend coverage under the SCHIP program. ""Now, Congress must do what the president said he would do,"" he said in his statement. The Senate could vote on the bill as early as Tuesday. Bush also threatened to veto a ""three-bill pileup."" ""There are now reports that Congressional leaders may be considering combining the Veterans and Department of Defense appropriations bills, and then add a bloated labor, health and education spending bill to both of them,"" he said. ""Congress should pass each bill one at a time in a fiscally responsible manner,"" he said. Bush also urged Congress to send him a ""clean defense appropriations bill and a war supplemental bill."" ""They ought to get me a bill that funds among other things bullets and body armor,"" he said. Bush also criticized Congress for trying to ""hold hostage"" funding for troops. ""It would be irresponsible to not give our troops the resources they need to get their job done because Congress was unable to get its job done,"" he said. Hoyer's release said Bush's comments on appropriations bills and fiscal responsibility ""ring hollow."" ""The fact is, this administration has pursued the most fiscally irresponsible policies in American history, turning record surpluses into record deficits and adding more than $3 trillion to the national debt,"" he said. ""Democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility today because we believe our government must pay for the things it purchases and not force our children to pay our bills.

"(CNN) -- The Tennessee Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to modify or overturn a lower court's ruling allowing Mary Winkler, convicted of killing her minister husband, visitation rights with the couple's three daughters. Holding baby Brianna, Mary Winkler stands next to Matthew. In the foreground are Mary Alice and Patricia. Charles and Diane Winkler, parents of slain minister Matthew Winkler, had asked the court to intervene and either revoke Mary Winkler's visitation rights or allow them to proceed only under supervision of a counselor. The children -- Patricia, Mary Alice and Brianna -- have been living with their grandparents since their mother was arrested last year. Winkler has not seen the children in 15 months, said Kay Farese Turner, her attorney. She said her client was ""absolutely elated about the news and believes this will be her best Christmas ever."" Turner said she believes the visit may come before Christmas. A jury convicted Winkler earlier this year of voluntary manslaughter in the shotgun death of Matthew Winkler -- not the first-degree murder conviction prosecutors had wanted. She said the slaying came after years of abuse, including physical violence and being forced to dress ""slutty"" for undesirable sex acts. Winkler received a three-year sentence, but a judge required her to serve only 210 days, gave her credit for the five months she had already served and allowed her to serve the remaining 60 days in a mental health facility. She was released in August. At the time of their father's death in March 2006, Patricia was 8, Mary Alice was 6 and Brianna was 1. Charles and Diane Winkler have moved to terminate Mary Winkler's rights and have filed a $2 million wrongful death suit against her for their son's slaying. The termination issue has not been decided in court. Turner said the court may want to determine what, if any, bond Winkler has with her children before making a decision. Attempts by CNN to contact attorneys for the Winklers were not immediately successful Wednesday. In September, a lower court granted Winkler visitation with her daughters pending the outcome of the custody battle. The court specified the visits be supervised by a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the children's interests and supervised by members of the couple Winkler is living with or by her sister. A subsequent appeal by the grandparents was denied, leading to their Supreme Court appeal. The Winklers said if their former daughter-in-law got visitation with the children at all, it should be under the supervision of a professional counselor. At a September hearing, according to court documents, they said the children ""exhibit fear and confusion"" toward their mother ""and her role in their father's death."" One expert, in testimony, quoted Patricia as saying her mother had killed her father and, ""I don't know if she will kill me. I want to ask her if she would do that to me. It scares me, kind of; if she did, well, I guess I would see my father."" The Winklers also said that after telephone calls with their mother, the children experienced ""urination accidents, sleeping problems, graphic nightmares and sleepwalking."" They said the lower court erred by failing to appoint the guardian ad litem until after the September hearing. Turner, however, said she believes terminating Winkler's parental rights would not be in the children's best interest. ""She has a faith rarely seen, and she loves those children,"" Turner said. After Matthew Winkler's death, Winkler fled with the girls to the Alabama coast, where she was arrested. She said during a September appearance on the ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" that she never expected to get away with killing her husband, but that she fled to be with her daughters and ""have some good times.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Football dignitaries gathered in Sheffield, northern England, on Wednesday to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of Sheffield FC -- the sport's oldest club. FIFA chief Blatter was among those in Sheffield to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of football's oldest club. Guests of honor at a service at Sheffield Cathedral included Sepp Blatter, president of football world governing body FIFA, and Massimo Moratti, president of Italian giants Inter Milan who are scheduled to play a friendly against Sheffield FC next month. Other guests attending a dinner in the club's honor included Real Madrid President Ramon Calderon and England and Manchester United legend Bobby Charlton. Pele -- widely recognized as the greatest footballer ever to play the game -- is also due in town next month to attend Sheffield FC's clash with Inter. Blatter was unveiling a bust of the club's co-founder William Prest -- one of two cricket fans who founded Sheffield FC, then known simply as Sheffield Club, on October 24, 1857 after deciding they needed a new sport to keep them active during the winter. Many more football clubs soon sprung up and by 1862 there were said to be 15 in and around the Sheffield area. The Football Association -- which codified the basic rules of the modern game -- was established in London the following year. Sheffield FC was instrumental in developing set rules for the game. The club studied existing rules and laid down a code of laws, which formed the foundation of the first commonly-accepted set of rules for the sport, according to the Sheffield FC Web site. The team was also responsible for several innovations in the game -- including heading, which was unheard of until 1875, when Sheffield traveled to London for a game. According to the team's Web site, the sight of the Sheffield players using their foreheads in addition to their feet reduced the London crowd to hysterics. Other innovations attributed to the team include the solid crossbar on the goal, corner kicks, free kicks for fouls, and playing a match under floodlights. Despite its celebrated place in the history of the world's most popular sport, Sheffield FC has never played at a professional level. The club currently competes in the Unibond League's First Division South, seven divisions beneath the English Premier League. The city of Sheffield has two professional clubs -- United and Wednesday -- who both currently play in English football's second tier, the Coca-Cola Championship. Sheffield FC's proudest achievement on the pitch came in 1904 when the team beat Ealing 3-1 to win the FA Amateur Cup in front of 6,000 people. But 100 years later in 2004, Blatter presented Sheffield FC with FIFA's ""Order of Merit"" -- an honor previously awarded only to the nine-time European champions Real Madrid.

"One is the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas; the other is Singapore. Each one has that certain je ne sais quoi that lifts them out of the humdrum and makes them exceptional. As far as Singapore goes, it's no surprise it has become second only to Monaco as the place where most business gets done over a grand prix weekend. It's a place you just really want to go. That message permeates, and has made it into one of the most desirable races on the calendar. For a start, the ambience is terrific - and, let's be honest, this is what appeals to the business visitors, rather than the demands of racing on one of the longest tracks in F1 in crippling humidity. Singapore is a fascinating destination full stop, thanks to its place at the crossroads of south-east Asia and colonial past. But hosting the race at night adds an extra dimension. The track jags through the city centre under lights, Chinese lanterns adding a dash of colour, the futuristic city skyline the backdrop. As the sun sets, the whole place seems to shimmer and sparkle for a while. Darkness takes the edge off the tropical heat, and a heady, luscious tropical atmosphere settles over the place. For those working at the race, there's a surreal edge to it, too. Know someone who volunteers in sport and deserves recognition for their efforts? Give them the chance to shine by nominating them. First track sessions at dusk, qualifying and race after dark means staying on European time. So you wake up at 2pm, finish work in the early hours and go to bed at six in the morning. You can eat in a hotel restaurant, some of which stay open all night for the race weekend. Better, though, to head to an all-night hawkers' market, where delicious, cheap local food is on offer from a myriad of stalls and you can drink in the atmosphere of the place. Oh, and the track is pretty good, too. It's no Spa or Suzuka, but the Marina Bay Circuit has a challenge all of its own. A long, long lap, a nearly two-hour race, bumps, 23 corners and intense humidity make it arguably the toughest grand prix on the calendar - only Malaysia comes close. Add it all up and it's a race not to be missed. Andrew Benson, chief F1 writer Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",formal
"*** COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 854/86 of 24 March 1986 laying down detailed rules for applying compulsory distillation as referred to in Article 41 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 of 5 February 1979 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (2), and in particular Article 41 (9) thereof, Whereas the distillation operations referred to in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2687/84 (4); Whereas the criteria required to establish a situation of serious imbalance on the market, triggering off compulsory distillation, should be defined; Whereas, in order to avoid the risk that compulsory distillation leads to inadequate supplies for the following year, it should be made clear that the need to ensure balance for the following year must be taken into account when the quantity for compulsory distillation is fixed; Whereas, in order to spread the burden of compulsory distillation equitably throughout the Community, the criteria for delimiting production regions with homogeneous characteristics must be defined; Whereas, in order to take into account the increase in the amount for compulsory distillation in line with yield per hectare, as provided for in Article 41 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, provision should be made for a breakdown of production by region according to yield classes to which percentages of production will be applied to obtain the anticipated quantity for each region; Whereas, to achieve proper, uniform application of the compulsory distillation measure, the yield to be taken into account and the quantity of wine and products upstream of wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 41 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 applies must be made clear; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 (5), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2391/85 (6), requires producers to declare quantities of wine and of products upstream of wine, and the production yield of such quantities; Whereas the producers to be exempted from compulsory distillation should be defined with a view to bringing down the administrative costs of applying the measure; Whereas the quantities of table wine obtained by applying the percentages fixed by the Commission to the production of each person subject to the compulsory distillation obligation must be known quickly in order to evaluate the impact of the measure on the market; whereas this may be achieved by requiring each person subject to the compulsory distillation, obligation to report the quantities which he must deliver for distillation, while allowing the competent authorities themselves to calculate as a matter of course the quantities for each producer and to notify producers of their obligations; Whereas the procedure for checking the characteristics of the wine delivered for distillation provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 relates to individual deliveries only and does not settle the problem of deliveries carried out jointly by several producers; whereas the latter situation is likely, however, to be encountered frequently in view of the small quantities to be delivered by certain producers subject to the compulsory distillation obligation; whereas, in consequence, provision should be made, in that case and in view of the varying situations applying in the various Member States, for checks on the characteristics of wines delivered to be carried out in accordance with national provisions; Whereas the tolerances permitted should be determined so as to facilitate compliance with obligations without entailing unwarranted expenditure for the EAGGF; Whereas, in order to ensure equal treatment for those subject to the obligation, producers who have disposed of their wine before compulsory distillation is triggered off should be permitted fo fulfil their obligations; whereas it is also economically justificable to allow producers whose wine can be disposed of without difficulty on the market on account of its quality to fulfil the obligation without being required to deliver their own wine; whereas, to achieve this result provisions should be made for producers to deliver, or have delivered, wine of other producers; Whereas, in the absence of a Community definition of rosé wine and for reasons of clarity, it should be made clear that rosé table wines will be treated in the same way as red table wines on account of the close economic relationship existing between them; Whereas the table wines considered for the purposes of this measure, as being in a close economic relationship with each type of wine should be determined; Whereas the risk that products of the distillation of certain wines cause disturbance on the market for wine spirits with a designation of origin should be avoided; whereas, to this end, pursuant to Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83, it should be laid down that a product with an alcoholic strength of less than 92 % vol may not be obtained by the direct distillation of such wines; Whereas certain deadlines must be laid down for completion of the operation by producers and distillers in order to ensure maximum effectiveness of the measure; Whereas distillers may, in accordance with Article 41 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, either receive aid for the product to be distilled or deliver the product of distillation to the intervention agency; whereas the amount of aid must be fixed on the basis of the criteria referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 when the measure is triggered off; Whereas, in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83, in order to receive aid, interested parties must submit an application together with certain supporting documents; whereas, to ensure the uniform functioning of the scheme in Member States, deadlines should be laid down for the submission of applications, for the payment of the aid due to distillers and for the submission of evidence that the purchase price has been paid; Whereas the price to be paid by the intervention agencies for the products delivered to them must be fixed on the basis of the criteria referred to in Article 18 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 when the measure is triggered off; Whereas the wine which must be delivered for compulsory distillation may be processed into wine fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adopted, in accordance with rules laid down in Articles 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83; Whereas, in order to enable the Commission to gain an overall view of compliance with compulsory distillation obligations, the Member States concerned must keep it regularly informed, on the basis of notifications from distillers, of the progress and results of distillation operations; Whereas the production structures and administrative difficulties peculiar to Greece justify the introduction, in that Member State in wine years 1985/86 and 1986/87, of compulsory distillation arrangements which, while enabling a result to be obtained which approaches, in terms of quantity that deriving from the application of the general arrangements, limit the measure to producers who have an adequate quantity of table wine available, and authorize the Greek Government itself to fix the percentages of table wine production to be delivered for distillation by the producers concerned; whereas the percentages thus fixed must ensure equal treatment for the parties concerned and must be based on the criteria provided for in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79; whereas Greek producers who are not subject to the compulsory distillation obligation may qualify for the measures provided for in Title I of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79; Whereas, pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, the reference period for exclusion from intervention measures for producers subject to the obligation who have not made delivery should be determined; whereas the application of that Article is without prejudice to the obligation on Member States to apply national penalties necessary to ensure in accordance with Article 64 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, the strict non-discriminatory application of compulsory distillation; Whereas it should be made clear that this Regulation is not applicable in Spain during the 1985/86 wine year or in Portugal before the end of the 1989/1990 wine year; whereas persons for whom distillation is compulsory should be prohibited from carrying out the distillation or having it carried out in either Spain or Portugal; Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 For the purposes of (a) and (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 41 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 the following definitions shall apply: (a) availabilities recorded at the beginning of the wine year: the quantity equal to the sum of the beginning-of-year stocks and production of table wine and wine suitable for yielding table wine, minus: - the quantity of table wine and wine lees to be distilled under Article 39 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 during the wine year, - the production and trade losses anticipated for the wine year; (b) normal utilization for the year: the quantity of table wine equal to the sum of the quantities scheduled to be, during the wine year: - used for direct human consumption, - processed into products falling within Common Customs Tariff headings Nos 22.06 or 22.10, - exported, minus the quantity of wine to be imported which is classifiable as table wine. Article 2 1. The average referred to in (c) of Article 41 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 shall be determined by applying the following coefficients to the representative price for each type of table wine: 1.2 // A I: // 25 // A II: // 1 // A III: // 0,5 // R I: // 65 // R II: // 8,4 // R III: // 0,1 2. The condition laid down in Article 41 (1) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 shall be considered to have been satisfied if, between 1 September and 31 December, the average referred to in paragraph 1 remains, for three consecutive weeks, at less than 82 % of the weighted average of the guide prices for each type of table wine to which the coefficients specified in paragraph 1 have been applied. Representative prices and guide prices shall be expressed in ECU per % vol alcohol. To this end, standard alcoholic strengths of 10 % vol for type A II and A III wines and 10,5 % vol for type R III wines shall be applied. If the representative price for a type of table wine is not available, the representative price used for that type of wine shall be the most recent one available. Article 3 When the total quantity of table wine subject to compulsory distillation is being fixed, account shall be taken of the need to ensure a level of forseeable end-of-year stocks which will guarantee that the availabilities for the following wine year will in any case be sufficient to cover normal utilization. Article 4 1. The production regions referred to in Article 41 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 shall be designated to take account, on the one hand, of production and climatic conditions and, on the other, of the differences existing between Member States in terms of administrative structure and legal requirements, particularly as regards the internal organization of cooperative wineries and producer groups. The said regions must coincide with administrative units larger than communes and comprise administrative units on which statistics are available for the reference wine years referred to in the second indent of the second subparagraph of Article 41 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79. 2. In respect of the wine years 1985/86 to 1989/90, the production regions referred to in Article 41 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 shall be defined as follows: - Region 1: the German sections of wine-growing zones A and B, - Region 2: the wine-growing region of Luxembourg, - Region 3: zone C I (a) and the French section of wine-growing zones B, C II and C III (b), - Region 4: wine-growing zone C I (b) and the Italian section of wine-growing zones C II and C III (b), - Region 5: wine-growing zone C III (a) and the Greek section of wine-growing zone C III (b). 3. Average production of table wine and products upstream of table wine in the regions referred to in paragraph 2 in the three consecutive wine years 1981/82, 1982/83 and 1983/84 was as follows: - Region 1: 1 341 700 hl - Region 2: 57 300 hl - Region 3: 40 182 000 hl - Region 4: 64 163 000 hl - Region 5: 4 632 000 hl Article 5 1. On the basis of the notifications from the Member States provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 41 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, the table wine production of each region shall be classified according to yield class. The definition of such classes shall take account of the quantity of table wine to be distilled in the region in question and the percentage of table wine production in the region which this quantity represents. The abovementioned classes shall be fixed on the basis of the yield classes, laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84. 2. Where compulsory distillation is introduced, a rising scale shall be fixed for each region based on the yield classes referred to in paragraph 1. The steps in this scale shall be fixed at levels which ensure that, taking into account the foreseeable exemptions under Article 9, the total volume resulting from applying the scale to the quantities falling within each yield class for a given region corresponds to the volume to be distilled in the said region. Article 6 1. The volume of a producer's production to which this Regulation applies shall be the sum of the quantities of products upstream of wine (grapes, grape musts, musts in fermentation, new wines still in fermentation, wines suitable for yielding table wine) and of wine entered in the 'Table wines' column of the production declaration, reproduced as Table B of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84. This volume shall be: (a) increased by: - the quantity of wine suitable for yielding table wine entered in the 'Wines and other products' column of the abovementioned production declaration, - the quantity of table wine made before 15 March from products upstream of wine acquired after the date on which a producer lodged his production declaration; (b) reduced by the quantity of products upstream of wine and the quantity of wine suitable for yielding table wine entered in the 'Wines and other products' column of the production declaration for which a producer provides evidence before 15 March that they have been processed into products other than those enterred in the 'Table wines' column of the abovementioned production declaration or that they have been disposed of to a third party before that date. The evidence referred to in (b) shall consist of the relevant entries in the records referred to in Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 (1). To enable the necessary checks to be carried out, producers disposing of products referred to in (b) after lodging their harvest declaration shall notify the name and address of the acquirer, the quantities involved and the date of disposal to the competent authorities. 2. For each producer who has obtained table wine from the processing and/or downgrading of one of the products entered in the 'Quality wines psr' column of the production declaration, the volume of production to be taken into consideration shall be the sum of all such products used to make that table wine during the period from 1 July preceding the wine year in question to 30 June of that wine year. 3. In the case of a producer who has made table wine from products bought after the final date for lodging his production declaration, the volume of production shall be the total quantity of products employed in vinification before 15 March and entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75. Article 7 The yield per hectare to be taken into consideration for each producer of table wine shall be the figure given in his grape harvest declaration, as provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84. Where this declaration is not required the yield shall be that stated on the wine production declaration provided for by that Regulation. In all cases the yield must include all the grapes produced on the areas worked by the declarant. However, - in Member States where a member of a cooperative winery or group is not obliged to submit a harvest declaration, in accordance with Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84, and cooperative wineries or producer groups lodge a single production declaration for all their members, the yield to be taken into consideration shall be that resulting from the weighted average of the yields of each consignment deliverd by the members. This average shall be determined in accordance with the method of calculation set out in the Annex of this Regulation, - the yield to be taken into consideration for producers who have made table wine by vinification of purchased products shall be that resulting from the weighted average of the yields of each consignment purchased and, where appropriate, the yield of the consignment of his own production. This average shall be determined in accordance with the method set out in the Annex of this Regulation, - in the case of a table wine made from grape varieties classified, in respect of the same administrative unit, as both wine grapes and grapes for other uses, the yield to be taken into consideration shall be based on the quantities normally made into wine as referred to in Article 40 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, - where the table wine is obtained from the processing and/or downgrading of one of the products entered in the 'Quality wines psr' column of the production declaration, the yield to be taken into consideration shall be that according to which the quality wine psr in question was obtained. Where the table wine is obtained by processing or downgrading several quality wines psr or a single quality wine psr from several vintages, the yield shall be fixed at a standard rate by the Member State concerned at a level not lower than that recorded for quality wines psr in the area of production in the wine year of distillation. Article 8 The quantity to be distilled by each producer subject to the obligation shall be calculated by applying to the volume referred to in Article 6 a percentage determined by reference to: - the yield per hectare relating to the volume of production in question, determined in accordance with Article 7, - the rising scale established in accordance with Article 5 (2) for the region in which the producer's holding is situated. Article 9 1. Exemption from the obligation specified in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 shall be granted to: - producers who have obtained during the wine year less than 50 hl of table wine, and - producers who, irrespective of the quantity of table wine obtained during the wine year, are required, after any deductions under the fourth subparagraph of Article 41 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, to deliver less than 5 hl of table wine for compulsory distillation. 2. Exemption from the obligation specified in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 shall be granted to producers in Member States whose total wine production is less than 25 000 hectolitres. Article 10 1. In each wine year during which the compulsory distillation referred to in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 is introduced, producers subject to the obligation who have lodged a production declaration as provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 shall, in accordance with Article 8, calculate the quantities that they are required to deliver for distillation and shall notify the result to the intervention agency or any other competent authority of the Member State in which their holding is located by 31 March at the latest, except in the case of 1985/86, when such notification shall take place not later than 18 April. The competent authority shall ascertain whether the quantities in the notification correspond to the quantity which the person making the declaration is required to deliver for distillation. 2. The competent authorities may themselves calculate, in accordance with Article 8, the quantities to be sent for distillation by certain categories of producers and notify them thereof. Such notifications shall be transmitted by 31 March at the latest, except in the case of 1985/86, when such notification shall take place not later than 18 April. Such notifications may be limited to certain categories of producer provided that the limitation is made on the basis of objective, non-discriminatory criteria. 3. Each producer who has obtained table wine from the processing and/or downgrading of one of the products entered in the 'Quality wines psr' column of the production declaration shall, in accordance with Article 8, calculate the quantities which he must deliver for compulsory distillation. The producer shall notify the intervention agency or any other competent authority of the Member State on whose territory his holding is located - not later than 31 March, except in the case of 1985/86, when such notification shall take place not later than 18 April, of the result of the calculation in respect of the quantities of table wine obtained from 1 July of the previous year to 15 March, - not later than 15 July, of the result of the calculation in respect of the quantities of table wine obtained from 16 March to 30 June. 4. At the time the notification referred to in this Article is transmitted or received, the producer or, as the case may be, the competent authority shall enter in the registers provided for in Article 53 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 the quantities of table wine which must be delivered for distillation. 5. Member States shall compile a summary statement of the figures obtained pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2 and the first indent of paragraph 3 and shall inform the Commission by 15 June of the quantities to be distilled, broken down by the yield classes fixed in accordance with Article 5 (1). The volumes to be distilled as referred to in the second indent of paragraph 3 shall be notified to the Commission by 15 September. Article 11 1. Should quantities of wine be transported together to the distillery the wine's characteristics, including quantity, colour and alcoholic strength, shall be verified in accordance with the provisions adopted by the Member States concerned. 2. No downward tolerance shall apply to the quantity to be deliverd for distillation by each producer subject to the obligation calculated in accordance with Article 8. 3. An upward tolerance of 2 % in relation to the quantity referred to in paragraph 2 shall apply: - to the sum of the quantities of table wine delivered by serveral producers subject to the obligation, where the application for aid or the application to deliver distillation products to the intervention agency submitted by a distiller concernes the wines corresponding to those producers' obligations; - to the quantity delivered by each producer subject to the obligation in other cases. Article 12 1. Persons subject to the obligation specified in Article 41 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 may deliver both table wine of their own production and table wine obtained from other producers as referred to in the second indent of Article 2 (1) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83. They may also: - carry out distillation in their own distillation facilities, - arrange for distillation to be carried out in the facilities of an approved distiller working under contract. 2. The obligation specified in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 shall be considered to have been satisfied even if the table wine is delivered by another person who himself produced it. In such cases, the certificate issued by the distiller pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 shall specify, in addition to the name and address of the producer delivering the wine, the name and address of the producer subject to the compulsory distillation requirement. The second subparagraph of Article 13 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 shall apply only to producers subject to the obligation specified in Article 41 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79. 3. Member States shall, in particular for the purposes of applying the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2, take the measures necessary to ensure that the quantities of wine delivered in performance of an obligation are those covered by the said obligation. However, in cases where the wine has been obtained and delivered for distillation in a Member State other than that of the producer subject to the obligation: - a certificate issued by the authority in the Member States of the producer subject to the obligation, as referred to in Article 10, and attesting that the quantity in question is that covered by the producer's obligation, must be presented to the distiller. A copy of this certificate must be forwarded to the competent authority of the Member State in which distillation takes place, - the certificate referred to in Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 shall be authenticated by the competent authority of the Member State in which distillation takes place, - a copy of this certificate shall be forwarded by the said authority to the authority referred to in the first indent before 25 October of the following wine year. 4. Deliveries of table wine must be made not later than: - 31 July if delivery is made to a distillery, - 15 July if delivery is made to a fortifier of wine for distillation. Deliveries may be made in the fortnight after the above dates. In that case the purchase price for the quantities concerned shall be reduced by an amount equal to 50 % of the aid fixed for the wine year in question. Both the aid and the price of the alcohol which is produced and delivered to the intervention agency shall be reduced by the same amount. 5. The distillation operations referred to in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 may not be carried out after 31 August. However, the distillation of wine delivered pursuant to Article 11 (2) or Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 may be carried out up to the date fixed by the competent national authority, in accordance with the said Articles. In the circumstances mentioned in the first paragraph of Article 23 of this Regulation, the competent authorities shall set time limits for distillation as necessary. Distillers shall forward to the intervention agency, not later than the tenth day of each month in respect of the previous month, a statement of the quantities of table wine distilled and the quantities of products obtained by distillation, broken down according to the categories specified in the first subparagraph of Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83. Article 13 1. The purchase price provided for in Article 41 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 shall be fixed at the time when the distillation measure referred to in the same Article becomes applicable. 2. The purchase price referred to in paragraph 1 shall be paid by the distiller to the producer within three months of the day on which each consignment of table wine enters the distillery. Article 14 1. The provisions of this Regulation relating to red table wine shall apply also to rosé table wine. 2. The provisions of this Regulation relating to a given type of table wine shall apply also to table wine that is in a close economic relationship with that type of table wine. For the purposes of this Regulation, the following shall be considered as being in a close economic relationship with table wine of type: - A I, white table wine that is not of type A I, A II or A III, - R I, red table wine with an actual alcoholic strength of not more than 12,5 % vol that is not of type R I or R III, - R II, red table wine with an actual alcoholic strength of not more than 12,5 % vol that is not of type R II or R III. Article 15 Only products with an alcoholic strength of at least 92 % vol may be obtained by the direct distillation of wines made from grapes of varieties which are classified, simultaneously for the same administrative unit, both as wine grape varieties and as varieties intended for the manufacture of wine spirits. Article 16 1. Distillers may receive aid in respect of the products obtained by the distillation referred to in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79. The amount of the aid shall be fixed at the time when such distillation becomes applicable. No aid shall be due for the quantity of alcohol contained in the product obtained by distillation in excess of that contained in the quantities of wine delivered in compliance with the limits laid down in Article 11 (3). 2. Distillers who wish to receive the aid specified in paragraph 1 shall submit, by 31 October, an application and the documents specified in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83. 3. The intervention agency shall pay the aid referred to in paragraph 1 within three months of submission of the application and documents referred to in paragraph 2. The distiller must provide the intervention agency, before 1 February of the following year, with evidence that he paid the producer the purchase price for the wine within the time limit laid down in Article 13 (2). If such evidence is not provided before 1 February, the intervention agency shall recover the aid paid. However, if the evidence is provided after the expiry of this time limit but before 1 May, the intervention agency shall recover only 20 % of the aid paid. If it is found that the distiller has not paid the producer the purchase price, the intervention agency shall pay the producer, before 1 June, an amount equal to the aid, if necessary through the intervention agency of his Member State. Article 17 1. Where the distiller intends to take advantage of the possibility provided for in the second indent of the first subparagraph of Article 41 (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, delivery to the intervention agency of products with an alcoholic strength of at least 92 % vol shall be made by 31 October or, if Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 applies, by the date set by the competent national authority. In the circumstances mentioned in the first subparagraph of Article 23 (1) of this Regulation the competent authorities shall set time limits for delivery as necessary. The quantity of alcohol contained in the product delivered by the distiller to the intervention agency in accordance with the second indent of the first subparagraph of Article 41 (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 may not exceed that contained in the quantities of wine delivered in compliance with the limits laid down in Article 11 (3). Pursuant to the first indent of the second subparagraph of Article 41 (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, the Member States where the overall volume for compulsory distillation does not exceed 100 000 hl may provide for their intervention agencies not to buy in the product referred to in the first subparagraph. 2. The price to be paid by the intervention agency to the distiller for the product delivered shall be fixed at the time when the distillation referred to in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 becomes applicable. If the distiller has received aid under Article 16, the price referred to in the first subparagraph shall be reduced by the amount of that aid. If the distiller has not received the aid referred to in the second subparagraph, Article 16 (2) shall be applicable mutatis mutandis. 3. The prices referred to in paragraph 2 shall be for neutral spirits as defined in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83. For other alcohol, the prices referred to in paragraph 2 shall be reduced, per % vol of alcohol and per hectolitre, by an amount fixed at the time when the distillation measure referred to in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 becomes applicable. 4. The price shall be paid by the intervention agency to the distiller within three months of the day on which the alcohol was delivered. The second, third and fourth subparagraphs of Article 16 (3) shall be applicable mutatis mutandis. Article 18 1. In cases as referred to in Article 26 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 the contract or the declaration of delivery of wine for fortification for distillation shall be submitted for approval to the competent intervention agency by 30 June. The intervention agency shall notify the producer of the outcome of the approval procedure within 15 days of the date on which the contract or declaration was submitted. 2. Fortification of wine for distillation may not take place after 31 July. 3.

"Not necessarily... Plants are finicky organisms that can't talk and tell you what's wrong. Depending the book you look at and the person you talk to, there are anywhere between something like 13 and 18 essential plant nutrients. Within the plant, nutrients can be either mobile or non-mobile. Nitrogen is a mobile plant element, being used in amino acid biosynthesis and essential to the chlorophyll molecule. Magnesium is also a critical element in chlorophyll. These both are mobile. When the plant is lacking mobile nutrients, they take them from the older tissues and put them where they are needed. On the other hand, the non-mobile nutrients show signs in the new growth, as the plant cannot move these elements around. Many elements become bound in cell membranes, and cannot be transported. Many times when lots of leaf tips are burnt, this could also be a nutrient toxicity, too hot of fertilizer, or too much fertilizer. It is always a good idea to consult a deficiency manual or guide to help diagnose a particular issue. A lot of the time though, pH is the number one thing that is off that causes deficiencies. Unfortunately, a lot of the time when you want an answer for a cause in plant sciences, you get a 'Well, it depends...' and it does, on many variables. tl;dr It all depends.",informal
"Figures show that for those aged 65, men can expect to live for another 19 years and women a further 21 years. But there is concern that too many elderly people are living in poor health. And the figures vary across the country, with the North East and North West having lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds than other regions. Life expectancy among older age groups in England rose to its highest level in 2014 - with male life expectancy increasing by 0.3 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at ages 75, 85 and 95 since 2013. Female life expectancy increased by the same amounts at the same ages. This comes after a fall in life expectancy in some older age groups between 2011 and 2012. The only region where male and female life expectancy did not increase in 2014 was in the North East, where male life expectancy was higher in 2013. Among local authorities in England, the majority showed an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65 - but one quarter showed a decrease. In the past, statistics have tended to focus on life expectancy at birth but now that most deaths in England occur in people over the age of 80, patterns of mortality in older age groups are becoming more important. Prof John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, said the report presented a positive national picture that made achieving ""a good quality of life in later years even more important"". ""This report is an opportunity to remind people that, even during mid-life, it is not too late to improve your health,"" he said. ""Most of us could make changes today, like stopping smoking, being more active or eating better, that would allow us to look forward to healthier later years."" He said it was not clear what had caused the variation in trends between local areas. Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Oxford, said there was an urgent need to find out why improvements had stalled in many parts of England in recent years. ""Beneath the headline figures of this report, there is evidence of worsening health for many older people in some parts of the country,"" he said. In Scotland, life expectancy continued to improve, with 65-year-old men expected to live for a further 17.4 years and women a further 19.7 years, according to the latest statistics.

"Civil protection officials have already revealed that rescuers were let down by the Siresp emergency services network during the four-day disaster. Now details have emerged of pleas for help that did not get through to commanders on the ground. The government has ordered an investigation into the network. The fire began in the Pedrógão Grande area during the afternoon on 17 June and within hours the failures of the emergency network, which relies on mobile antennas, were becoming clear. The first failure came at 19:45 on 17 June. Three people dialled the 112 emergency number from an abandoned house in nearby Casalinho to report that the building was surrounded by flames. Emergency services tried to contact the local command post and the deputy commander but were unable to get through, according to a civil protection authority (ANPC) timeline, described by Portuguese media as a ""black box"". Five minutes later, officials were unable to contact a command post to help a father and son in trouble a few kilometres away in Troviscais. These and several other cases are documented throughout the night by the Público and Jornal de Notícias websites. At 01:02 on 18 June comes the most chilling entry on the civil protection authority's log, in a reference to the deaths of 47 people on a single stretch of the N-236 road. Thirty of the victims died in their cars. A district relief operations command appeals for help in tackling ""breakdowns in the Siresp network"" and for ""lifting the dead victims who are in the road, making it impossible for combat means to get through"". The civil protection authority has already confirmed ""failures in the Siresp network"" that continued throughout the four-day emergency and on the Saturday evening, firefighters resorted to using their old radio network. The government on Monday said it had asked for a study into Siresp's operation, particularly during serious accidents and disasters. Prime Minister Antonio Costa said last week that the network had suffered because cables and communication towers had been damaged by the fire. However, he said the mobile network had provided temporary mobile antennas. The forest fires were the worst in Portugal's history, with 64 dead and 254 injured. Portugal's Siresp (joint emergency and security network system) has had a chequered past. It was set up in 2006 as a partnership between the government and private sector. The system stopped working during a rescue attempt in storms in January 2013 and it was linked to the deaths of two firefighters a few months later.",formal

Motorists breaking a red light will automatically receive three penalty points and a fine of up to 120 euros (Â£88). Penalty points will increase to five if there is a court conviction. The first such system in Ireland has been introduced in response to the large number of collisions between road vehicles and trams at the junction. Since the Luas went into operation in 2004 there have been 338 collisions between trams and vehicles and 95% have occurred on the red line, which serves Saggart and Tallaght to the city centre.

"The force's interest in using the birds of prey follows trials in the Netherlands. Drones - pilot-less aircraft which are controlled remotely - are used by police forces to capture footage on difficult terrain, including cliffs. But there are concerns criminals are also using the new technology. In November, the Ministry of Justice said a drone used to smuggle mobile phones, SIM cards and drugs into the grounds of HMP Manchester had been recovered by guards. The MoJ reported nine attempts to use drones to infiltrate prisons in England and Wales in the first five months of 2015. A think tank has also warned that drones could be used by terrorist groups. The UK Air Proximity Board said last month that drones had been involved in four serious near misses at UK airports. The birds would help by taking down the aircraft, which they would consider to be prey. However, Jemima Parry-Jones, who is the director of the International Centre of Birds of Prey in Gloucestershire, described the idea as a ""gimmick"". ""Eagles are big, powerful birds; they should not be flown in built-up areas. And secondly in terms of the safety of the bird, you're asking it to grab hold of a drone, which often have four rotating blades keeping it in the air,"" she said. ""If the police in the UK are asking the right experts they should listen to our advice. ""If you don't believe us, try putting your own fingers into the propeller of a reasonably sized drone and see what happens."" But a spokesman for the RSPCA said: ""In principle we would not have an issue with police forces training eagles in an attempt to tackle drones, although we would have concerns over the welfare of the birds. ""At the moment, however, there is not enough information available for us to be able to make an informed comment.""

"DHAKA, Bangladesh (CNN) -- More than 1,700 people have died in Bangladesh after a devastating tropical cyclone ripped through the western coast of the country, and the toll is expected to rise, a government spokesman tells CNN. Families stand amid the wreckage caused by the cyclone Friday in southern Bangladesh. Brig. Gen. Qazi Abedus Samad, director of operations for the country's armed forces, told CNN Saturday the toll had reached 1,723, and the figure is expected to rise. As flood waters recede, aid workers say they expect to find scores more bodies when remote villages are finally reached and the counting is done. They face debris-blocked roads, no electricity and almost nonexistent communications. In addition to the dead, another 15,000 people have been injured. Thousands of people have been displaced and many are still missing. Cyclone Sidr, with sustained winds of at least 131 mph (210 kph), made landfall Thursday night along the western coast of Bangladesh near the border with India, unleashing floodwaters. Government spokesman Fahim Munaim told CNN by telephone that the government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues. He said the extent of the cyclone's damage may be much worse because emergency relief had not been able to reach remote areas. The government has identified the 12 worst districts -- all of them located on the southern coast -- out of the 23 affected by the cyclone, Munaim said. See victims pick up the pieces after the storm » . The Bangladeshi air force, army and navy are working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced. Power is still out in much of the country but it is being restored. Watch how the cyclone spawns a large relief effort » . Vince Edwards, national director of the relief agency World Vision in Bangladesh, said the high wind speeds of Cyclone Sidr have laid waste to the all-important rice crop and caused a huge loss of livestock. He said 280,000 families have been rendered homeless by the cyclone, but many have been able to get shelter from family members. World Vision is deploying 135 staffers and 7,000 volunteers to provide food, shelter and other relief. The group is appealing for $1.5 million in further funds to assist some 9.300 families rebuild their homes. In Dhaka -- about 200 miles north of the worst-hit region -- there were power outages, massive traffic jams and spotty phone service, CNN's Cal Perry said from the city. ""From an infrastructure perspective, the country absolutely has been brought to its knees,"" he said. Red Crescent spokeswoman Nabiha Chowdhury told CNN that communication with her agency's teams who have arrived in the stricken area is spotty, but they have resources with them to immediately help people with water purification, which she said was a top priority. Those teams have cash with them to buy relief supplies from local wholesalers, said Chowdhury, who said the latest number of people injured was 15,000 with 1,000 missing. Chowdhury said about 600,000 people had fled, adding that about 2 million people lived along the coast. The U.N. World Food Programme said it has enough high-energy biscuits to feed 400,000 people for several days. Another humanitarian group, Save The Children, appealed for aid from the public. ""Many families have lost everything, including their homes and their crops, and they are struggling to survive,"" said Kelly Stevenson, Save the Children's Bangladesh director. ""We are appealing to the U.S. public to support our efforts to assist children and families affected by this disaster. We remain very concerned about possible outbreaks of cholera and severe diarrhea due to the lack of access to clean water,"" he said in a written statement. The U.S. Department of State pledged Friday pledging ""to work with the government and foreign donors to assist in relieving the effects of the disaster."" Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S. Mission in Bangladesh, anticipating the storm, pre-positioned 16 Zodiac boats, water treatment systems, water ambulances and food for a more rapid response. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was expected to approve plans to send up to three Navy amphibious warships, with up to 3,500 Marines, to locations off the coast of Bangladesh to assist in relief efforts.

"The camp, where teenage diarist Anne Frank was among thousands to die, was liberated by British soldiers in 1945. The UK monarch, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, laid a wreath at a memorial there on the final day of her four-day state visit to Germany. She met British veterans who liberated the camp, and heard stories of the ""horrific"" scenes that greeted them. More than 50,000 prisoners from all over Europe were killed at Bergen-Belsen or died later as a result of their treatment in the camp. This was a Queen who lived through World War Two as a teenager, coming to learn first-hand about some of the very worst excesses of a former enemy. With Prince Philip she passed the mounds that mark where the mass graves are. There are 13 mounds. They contain the remains of more than 20,000 people. There was no pomp or ceremony; just a couple from the wartime generation taking their time to reflect and to pay their respects. The 89-year-old Queen and her husband, who's 94, walked quite a distance through what remains of the camp, and met a few of those who lived and three of the British soldiers who set them free. The survivors and the liberators told them about their shared experience of horror. At the end the Queen said to one person: ""It's difficult to imagine isn't it?""

She was taken on a tour of the site - which was razed to the ground and is now a museum and memorial to those who died - with the minimum of protocol. She met with representatives of Jewish and Christian communities, as well as a small group of survivors and liberators. Among them was veteran pilot Captain Eric ""Winkle"" Brown, 96. The Queen asked him what sort of scene greeted the British troops when he first arrived. ""I told her this was just a field of corpses,"" he said. He said the Queen replied: ""It must have been horrific really."" ""She was listening very carefully. I would say she was quite affected by the atmosphere here. You can't avoid it, can you?"" he added. The Queen also visited a memorial to Anne Frank and her sister Margot. Millions of copies of Anne Frank's Diary, written during the two years the teenager and her family hid from the Nazis in occupied Amsterdam, have been sold across the world. Dr Jens-Christian Wagner, head of the Bergen-Belsen Memorial who gave the royal couple a guided tour, said the experience of visiting the site had been an emotional one for the Queen. British troops found 60,000 prisoners when they entered the gates in April 1945, suffering from malnutrition, disease and the brutal treatment they had endured. Thousands of corpses also lay unburied on the camp grounds. Another of the first British soldiers to arrive after liberation described the scene to BBC Radio 5live. Corporal Bernard Levy, who was 19 at the time, said: ""It was so horrendous that nobody could take it in. ""For 68 years I'd shut the whole subject out of my mind. ""But we've got to make sure that this particular horror stays in people's minds."" The visit to the former concentration camp was the Queen's final engagement before returning to the UK. During her official visit, she also met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and visited Berlin and Frankfurt.",formal

The church has seen plenty of controversy and critics consider it a cult. So why are observant Christians embracing some of its teachings?

But when it comes to practicing what they preach in a modern world, borrowing from Scientology helps. The Rev. Charles Kennedy, of the Glorious Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal church in Tampa, Florida, and the Rev. James McLaughlin, of the Wayman Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Houston, Texas, are among the theological hybrids. Watch Rev. Kennedy preach » . They say they are not scared off by programs with ties to a church that critics say has aggressive recruiting, secretive ways and rigid theology. As men of God rooted in Christian values, they do not see Scientology as a threat to their faith, but rather as a tool to augment it. Scientology was founded in the 1950s by L. Ron Hubbard, a science fiction writer. Followers are taught that they are immortal spiritual beings called thetans. Although the church says there is a supreme being, its practices do not include worshipping God. ""I'm looking for solutions, and the people that I help, they don't ask me who L. Ron Hubbard is,"" said McLaughlin, who works with addicts. ""You know what they say? 'Thank God.' "" Critic Rick Ross, a court-certified Scientology expert, sees something more sinister at work. He warned that mainstream acceptance makes it easier for the Scientologists to achieve their ultimate goal -- new recruits. ""Their hope is that through these programs, people will become more interested in L. Ron Hubbard, what else Mr. Hubbard had to offer, and this will lead them eventually to Scientology,"" Ross said. The church has long been in the headlines for practices critics say are little more than cult-like mind control. It is also known for its stable of devout celebrity followers. And according to published reports, Scientology has been recently diversifying its outreach to include other religions and ethnic groups. Kennedy, McLaughlin and a handful of other Christian church leaders -- no one can say how many -- are finding answers to their communities' needs in Scientology's social programs. For Kennedy, it began two years ago when he attended a meeting at the Church of Scientology's spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, Florida. He was introduced to a book called ""The Way to Happiness"" -- Hubbard's 64-page, self-described ""common sense guide to better living."" In the book, which lays out ways to maintain a temperate lifestyle, Kennedy found a message he believed could help lift his predominantly lower income African-American congregation. He said the book's 21 principles help them with their struggle in an urban environment where there is too much crime and addiction and too little opportunity. Kennedy knew that before he could introduce any Scientology-related text to his congregation, he would have to prove that it did not contradict his Christian beliefs. And so, he found Scripture to match each of the 21 principles. Now Kennedy uses ""The Way to Happiness"" as a how-to supplement to his sermons. He believes it is easier to understand and clearer to follow than ancient Scriptures taken from the Bible. When asked whether Scientology's values contradict the religion of Jesus Christ, Kennedy replies, ""Sometimes yes. Sometimes no."" But he says his congregation can relate to ""The Way to Happiness."" Kennedy admits other pastors have criticized him, but the disapproval is not enough to discourage him. He insists that he has witnessed the changes ""The Way to Happiness"" has inspired in people. He also maintains that the Scientologists, many of whom he calls friends, are successful at outreach and getting desired results. At Kennedy's C. L. Kennedy Center, free tutoring based on Hubbard's ""study tech"" philosophies is provided to dozens of children and some adults. Kennedy's daughter, Jimirra, is one of the instructors. She said ""study tech"" and the Scientology orientation classes she attended helped her graduate from high school and become a poised woman. Though Jimirra Kennedy insists she does not ascribe to the religious side of Scientology, she still considers herself, at least in part, Scientologist. ""We say this all the time and I know my father says this, but I am like a Pentecostal Scientologist, that's what we are."" Critics like Ross are alarmed by such a blurring of the lines. They consider it a marketing win for Scientology. In Houston, McLaughlin says he is not one to argue with success. Driven by a need to address the rampant drug problem in his community, McLaughlin spent years searching for a solution before he discovered ""Narconon,"" Scientology's nonprofit drug rehab center, in 2001. McLaughlin trained at Narconon and brought the techniques back to his community to launch ""First Step Faith Step,"" a program that combines Hubbard's methods with the teachings of Christianity. He claims a 70- to 80-percent rehabilitation success rate. Kennedy and McLaughlin said they have never lost a member of their congregations to Scientology. ""I think that they truly believe that this may help their communities, but in my opinion, they're naïve,"" Ross said. Scientologists, he added, ""have their own agenda."" The Church of Scientology would not grant CNN an interview, nor would its representatives answer questions about the Hubbard-based programs. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"I am in mechatronics too. Graduating in a few months. It is an awesome program, and you do learn a lot. While it is kind of competitive, we are a very cohesive bunch (together from start to finish) and as such, we try to help each other as much as possible. The amount of cooperation I have seen is really heartwarming. In addition, we learn a lot, but we don't go very much in depth. Last term, for example, I had my first mechanical design job. I hadn't learned much regarding nuts, screws, and washers. The senior engineer at the company explained, though, and thanks to the background we had gotten, I understood it really well. Full responsibility was handed over to me for about three weeks. You will probably be biased to one subject or the other, but you will learn how everything else is connected.

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Former football star O.J. Simpson will be held without bail after his arrest on robbery and assault charges, police announced late Sunday. Police released this mug shot of O.J. Simpson after his arrest. Simpson is accused of having directed several other men in an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia in a room at a Las Vegas hotel room. Las Vegas authorities said they have no information leading them to believe Simpson was carrying a firearm during the alleged incident at the Palace Station Hotel and Casino. Police said Simpson and other men burst into the room and walked out with the memorabilia, including some that was unrelated to Simpson, police said. ""We don't believe that anyone was roughed up, but there were firearms involved,"" Lt. Clint Nichols told reporters. Nichols said the firearms were pointed at the victims. A reporter asked Nichols: Was ""O.J. was the boss in that room?"" Nichols responded, ""That is what we believe, yes."" Watch Simpson transferred Sunday in handcuffs » . The alleged victims were identified as Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia collector who described the incident as ""a home invasion-type robbery,"" and Alfred Beardsley, who has been quoted by celebrity Web site TMZ.com as saying that Simpson later apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident. Acting on a tip, police met over the weekend at McCarran International Airport with 46-year-old Walter Alexander, of Mesa, Arizona, who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster's information, Capt. James Dillon told reporters. Alexander was arrested Saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon. He was released on his own recognizance and returned to Mesa either Saturday night or early Sunday morning, Dillon said. In addition, investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied Simpson into the hotel room, Nichols said. Nichols said, ""There is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and O.J. Simpson."" Though Simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself, two firearms that police said were used were recovered early Sunday in one of three searches. Investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found. Nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police. ""There is no truth to that whatsoever,"" he said. ""That came as a result of some language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our victims to believe that they may have been police."" Simpson, 60, has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him, but he has denied that any weapons were involved. ""Whether the property belonged to Mr. Simpson or not is still in debate,"" Nichols said. ""We are still in the process of sorting that out."" Nichols also said that some of the property taken had Simpson's signature. But ""there was some other property taken as well,"" he said. ""I believe there were some Joe Montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff."" The latest charges against Simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution, more than a decade after the June 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman. Simpson was acquitted of murder the following year. The trial riveted much of the United States. But in 1997, a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the Goldman family. Simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $33.5 million for the deaths . Goldman had gone to Nicole Simpson's Los Angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings. Goldman's sister, Kim Goldman, said she wasn't surprised by the robbery allegations, since Simpson ""thinks he can do no wrong."" ""He's capable of stabbing people to death, so I think robbery is nothing surprising,"" she said. ""Normal, logical, civil-minded, law-abiding people don't storm a room with guns demanding stuff back."" Fromong had testified on Simpson's behalf in the civil case, telling the court that prices for Simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict. His testimony was part of the defense's contention that Simpson could not afford to pay the Goldmans. Simpson recently wrote a book originally titled ""If I Did It"" and had planned to publish it himself, but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal. A bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the Goldmans the rights to the book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award. The Goldmans retitled the book, ""If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer."" That book just hit bookstores. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.",formal

"14 years experience here. It's not about what you do, it is how you do it. Many guilds base themselves on what they do instead of how they do it. Example: You want to do PvP. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of guilds out there that do PvP. That is -what- you do. Now -how- do you do it? Figure that out and keep it as your guild signature. If the -how- is that you train your members, teach them, have set trainers, accept complete newbies and show them the ropes using training sessions. Then that is how you do it, how you get the team together, how you keep the team ready for battle etc. Some people will like this and join up with you and stay with you because of that. Others will not like this and leave and join someone else. Those might join, for example, a guild where there is no training, no newbies are accepted and everyone plays at around the same level and the leader curses and yells at the members when they do something wrong, calling it tough love. Some members will leave because of this and join the first guild, others will like the bootcamp style ordering around stay in this guild. Both are pvp guilds. Another example for the pvp guild would be the seemingly random BYOB guild that focuses heavily on activity. Something is -always- happening. The BYOB nature of the guild means new techniques may be discovered but it also means it will lose a lot of matches because.. BYOB. (Bring Your Own Build) Another (probably better) explanation of what I mean with ""how"" is.. How do you handle internal conflicts? They -will- happen. My guild, The Order of the Black Lion investigates conflicts by taking everyone separate. We have a set procedure for that. Other guilds put all parties together and work it out by talking. We separate and work it out based on facts we get. We then do psychological mumbojumbo and fix stuff. Some guilds trust the older member over the newer member or trust higher ranked officers over lower ranked members. That works too. Not sure if it works well, but it works. I'm biased towards keeping everyone same level. Oh and regarding officers... This too is all about the -how- and the personality and signature of your guild. How do you pick officers? What are your officers for? Some guilds give officer positions to the first 10 members who join. I've never joined or had any dealing with those types of guilds so I don't know how effective that is (ahem). Other guilds have the officers be personal friends of the guild leader. It makes sense for the leader to make his friends officers because he knows them and can ""trust"" them. But not everyone who is a friend is a good officer. In my guild, officer positions are temporary job-like positions given to people who do the thing we expect the officer to do anyway or are capable of doing it. Some guilds have their officers be long time members or members who are good at what they do etc. Another thing: the leader. What you do is PvP. How you manage stuff, how you do things is what defines what the guild is like. Change the leader to someone else and the guild changes fundamentally. The leader is the foundation. You set the identity, you set what the guild does. Members will come and go but the ones who identify with your guild are the ones who will stay, the ones who don't, will leave. And that is ok. Because of this, you are the guardian, the one who safeguards the guild, the one who leads its progression. Basically the one who leads. Obviously. If the guild changes into a direction your core member don't identify with or don't feel part of, you lose those members. You will get new ones but it won't be the same. What I mean is that when you set the identity, you also have to keep it, uphold it, etc. That's stability. **TL;DR**: Get an identity/philosophy and hold it",informal

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It is an irony of contemporary art-museum management: Sometimes the museum that creates an exhibition doesn't get to premiere it. In a treatment of a Bridgeman Art Library photo, the High shows visitors Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery."" This is the case this week, as Atlanta's High Museum of Art couples its public opening of a second year of Louvre-fueled shows from Paris, France, with an exhibition about influences on the Impressionists. ""Inspiring Impressionism"" is organized by the Denver Art Museum. It opened Tuesday at the High, to run there through January 2008. With the backing of Northern Trust, the show will then travel to Denver February 23 to May 25, 2008, and then on to the Seattle Art Museum from June 19 to September 21, 2008. Why not start in Denver? That museum this fall is host to pieces seen in the first year of the three-year Louvre Atlanta series of exhibitions. Like priceless dominos falling, these shows roll around the country and the world, globalization dictating galas, super-sensitive custom shipping companies probably among the biggest winners. See a gallery of images from 'Inspiring Impressionism' at the High Museum of Art » . Another unintended effect may be shadowing of one important outing by another. It should be interesting to learn whether showing ""Inspiring Impressionism"" at the High on the same time frame as the second year of Louvre Atlanta pays off. Do all the boats in Monet's ""Autumn on the Seine, Argenteuil"" float? Smart museum-goers will see it all. ""The Louvre and the Ancient World"" and the companion show ""The Eye of Josephine,"" after all, look at some of the oldest treasures in the Louvre's vast holdings. See a gallery of some of the highlights of the Louvre Atlanta shows » . The fit is comfortable, in a way, the Impressionist movement of the turn of the last century finding its main proponents in French artists. The emphasis here, however, is on what older works may have moved and motivated such artists as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne. One very distinctive connection from the Louvre Atlanta opener of last year is a section of this new show that looks at the tradition of modern-era artists learning by studying the work of masters at the Louvre, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo's ""The Beggar Boy"" of around 1650 being one of the most-copied canvases in Western art's modern history. From the outset, visitors to ""Inspiring Impressionism"" are reminded of the Louvre treasures all around them at the High: The Impressionism show's entry gallery is flanked by a handsome photographic treatment of Louis Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery at the Louvre"" from between 1850 and 1870. In that original painting and color lithograph that followed, Arnout captured the bustle of artists working and visitors promenading in the Louvre's chief exhibition space that runs along the Seine in Paris. In fact, even older-era echoes of this same concept are encountered on looking at Louvre Atlanta's ""The Tiber"" marble from the first century A.D., you're reminded that Michelangelo himself was aware of that piece, influenced by it, presumably inspired by it. So a surprise symmetry takes shape at the High this fall, as visitors contemplate dialogues between museums (the Louvre, the High, Denver, Seattle), the viewers of art in Europe and the United States, and the artists themselves in France, in the U.S. and elsewhere. High director Michael Shapiro calls these synchronicities ""visual evidence of connections."" His colleagues Timothy Standring of Denver and Ann Dumas of London, England, have held up their end of this conversational eyeful with timely contributions, glimpses of Old World craft from Titian and Velasquez to Fragonard and Rubens -- and the ""moderns"" who saw beyond them to a new age of aesthetic debate. Don't miss some of the comments and writings of various artists, used as part of the display of the show at the High. Degas may have said it most honestly: ""No art is less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of refection and the study of the Old Masters.""

"COUNCIL DECISION of 5 July 2004 on the existence of an excessive deficit in Hungary (2004/918/EC) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(6) thereof, Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission, Having regard to the observations made by Hungary, Whereas: (1) According to Article 104 of the Treaty, Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits; this applies also to Member States with a derogation, the case of all countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004. (2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation. (3) The excessive deficit procedure under Article 104 provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit and the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (1), lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provisions of the said Protocol. (4) Article 104(5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur. Having examined all relevant factors taken into account in its report in accordance with Article 104(3) and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4), the Commission concluded in its opinion of 24 June 2004 that there exists an excessive deficit in Hungary. (5) Article 104(6) of the Treaty lays down that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. (6) The overall assessment leads to the following conclusions: the general government deficit reached 5,9 % of GDP in 2003 in Hungary, above the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value. The excess of the general government deficit over the reference value did not result from an unusual event outside the control of the Hungarian authorities, nor was it the result of a severe economic downturn, in the sense of the Stability and Growth Pact. The general government deficit is likely to remain above 3 % of GDP in 2004. In particular, according to the Commission spring 2004 forecast, the deficit is projected to reach 4,9 % of GDP in 2004, while the convergence programme of Hungary expects a deficit of 4,6 % of GDP. The debt ratio, which was 59 % in 2003, is likely to remain just below the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value in 2004, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISON: Article 1 From an overall assessment it follows that an excessive deficit exists in Hungary.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The head of Britain's intelligence services has warned that children as young as 15 are becoming involved in terrorist-related activity. Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their support for al Qaeda-inspired terrorism. ""As I speak, terrorists are methodically and intentionally targeting young people and children in this country. They are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism,"" he told a gathering of newspaper editors in Manchester. Evans said the figure of 2,000 -- an increase of 400 since November 2006 -- only included those the intelligence services knew about and that the actual number could be double. He said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Britain since the September 11 attacks. The MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in the UK had come from al Qaeda's remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Pakistan. However, he said in the last 12 months terrorist plots on British soil were increasingly inspired by al Qaeda cadres in other countries, including in Iraq and East Africa. ""There is no doubt now that al Qaeda in Iraq aspires to promote terrorist attacks outside Iraq. There is no doubt that there is training activity and terrorist planning in East Africa -- particularly in Somalia -- which is focused on the UK,"" he told the Society of Editors meeting. According to Evans, there had been ""no decrease"" in the number of Russian covert intelligence officers operating in Britain since the end of the Cold War. He said that resources that could be devoted to counter-terrorism were instead being used to protect Britain against spying by Russia, China and others. ""A number of countries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense,"" he said.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuters) -- Nigeria's television survival show has been suspended after a contestant drowned in preparation for the program, said Dutch brewer Heineken's local unit which is sponsoring the show. Anthony Ogadje, 25, and nine other contestants had gone to Shere Hills Lake in Nigeria's hilly Plateau State to prepare for the ""Gulder Ultimate Search,"" which sets a variety of physical challenges for participants. A statement from Nigerian Breweries on Monday said Ogadje died suddenly and he was thought to have drowned. ""All attempts to revive him by the attendant medical team and the lifeguards, including his fellow contestants, failed,"" said Nigerian Breweries, which is majority-owned by the Dutch giant. Broadcasting had been due to start on Thursday. In the show, the weakest contestants are evicted one by one until a winner emerges. The prize money is a big attraction in a country where most people live in extreme poverty and benefit little from Nigeria's oil wealth. The winner was to get 5 million naira (about $39,000) in cash, a four-wheel drive jeep and another 500,000 naira (about $3,900) to buy clothes.

"Mr Fox, 54, from London, denies eight counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault between 1988 and 2014. He said there was often ""horseplay"" with colleagues, involving ""piggybacks, tickling and squeezing"". But he told Westminster Magistrates' Court such behaviour was consensual. Mr Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, became well known for presenting the chart show on Capital Radio, and was a judge on the ITV show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell. He joined Magic 105.4 in 2005, where he presents the breakfast show, Foxy in the Morning. He is currently not hosting the show. Giving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with ""hundreds"" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year. Under questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses. ""It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that."" He said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a ""full performance"" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another. Mr Caplan asked: ""Could those comments become edgy or sexual?"" Mr Fox replied: ""Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top."" Referring to the ""horseplay"" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, ""otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio"". Asked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: ""I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it? ""Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed."" He added: ""But I don't think my behaviour has changed. I'm the same guy now, with the same morals, as I was then."" One former colleague has accused the DJ of squeezing her breasts from behind. Asked about that, he said: ""That would be wholly wrong, totally disrespectful, and it's not something I would do."" The complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her. Addressing that allegation, he said people in his then-workplace often pretended to have been caught in compromising positions - it was a ""play-acting high jinks thing"", he said. Mr Fox told the court he had seen it ""many times"", but agreed that out of context, the ""Benny Hill-style"" comedy could have seemed inappropriate. Prosecutor John Price QC said: ""She says that when you did that to her, she did not consent to it. Are you in a position to dispute that?"" Mr Fox replied: ""I can't get in (her) head."" Mr Price continued: ""Did you ask her before you did it if it was okay?"" to which the defendant replied: ""No."" Mr Fox also denied having sexual contact with a 15-year-old fan, including during a private tour of Capital Radio's record library. ""It never happened,"" he said, although he did acknowledge he ""could have easily taken her for a tour"". Mr Fox agreed it would be ""quite wrong"" for an adult man to ""stick his tongue"" into the mouth of a teenage girl, as the woman alleged he had done in the station's car park on another occasion.

"(RealSimple.com) -- Why shoes are called ""pumps"" and other strange-but-true stories behind the clothes and accessories you know and love. So, how did the trend for pointed-toe shoes start? Manolo who? Long before they ever made an appearance on the TV show ""Sex and the City,"" pointed shoes were favored by Polish nobles, who introduced the fashion to England on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s. The shoes, dubbed ""crackowes"" or ""poulaines"" -- after Kraków, Poland -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging. In 1363 the English attempted to rein in the look by law, assigning shoe spans to social classes. Commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches, while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length. Who invented the sports bra? In 1977 University of Vermont student Lisa Lindahl was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra wasn't holding up. With the help of two classmates, Lindahl sewed together two jock straps and -- presto! -- the sports bra was born. The coeds founded the company Jogbra a year later, garnering eternal gratitude from exercise-loving women everywhere. Almost 40,000 sports bras are now sold annually. Real Simple: Best bras for every figure . Is there a real Mary Jane behind Mary Jane shoes? Not quite: The most widely held theory is that the single-strapped footwear was named for a character in ""Buster Brown,"" a children's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s. Mary Jane was either Buster Brown's sweetheart or sister, depending on which source you consult. What's the connection between Shakespeare and raincoats? Gabardine, a water-repellent fabric invented by Burberry, got its first mention from Shakespeare. The Bard used the word in The Merchant of Venice to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms. During World War I, British officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original Burberry trench. Who was the first person known to have pierced ears? No one knows who originated the style, but there's evidence that as early as 2500 B.C. Sumerian women wore pierced earrings -- gold half-moon hoops. And guys tired of defending their diamond studs can rest easy: Men have been wearing earrings since ancient Egypt, where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 B.C. Real Simple: Best way to clean jewelry . What was the inspiration for Lilly Pulitzer's colorful printed dresses? Bored Palm Beach socialite Lilly Pulitzer opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time, but she found one drawback: The citrus concoctions discolored her clothes. She instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains, and the ""Lilly"" design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born. The style was an instant hit with customers, who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice. How did pumps, stilettos, and sneakers get their names? The term pump first popped up in 1550 in England, where male servants sported the style. It is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose-fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump. The word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore ""sneaky."" The modern usage of stiletto, a Renaissance-era Italian word for an assassin's narrow-bladed knife, made its debut in 1953. The word turned out to be especially appropriate, because the shoes' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors. When did folks start toting around umbrellas? For thousands of years, in such places as Egypt, China, Japan, Mesopotamia, and India, umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun. (When it rained, the well-to-do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs.) Umbrellas weren't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. And another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight, portable, and available to average Joes. Have bikinis always been so popular? Hardly! Named for the nuclear-testing site Bikini Atoll, the suits first appeared in 1946, but American women thought them immodest. Not until the 1960s were they accepted, possibly helped by the hit song ""Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini."" Were French cuffs really created for the battlefield? It is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat. But, in fact, French royalty invented the style in the 1500s, when flowing sleeves were the rage; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners. Amusingly, the competitive English tried to take credit for the fashion, which to this day they refer to only as ""double cuffs."" Have women always carried purses? Once upon a time, ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing (sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack) and accessible through slits in their skirts. Around 1800, thinner, silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue, and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections. The solution? They began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead. Why is underwear nicknamed ""drawers""? In the 16th century, drawers became a common term for both men's and women's underpants. Made of linen, the items were no-frills and looked more or less interchangeable (this being well before Victoria ever had a secret; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century). Most likely, underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body.

"The area near the main administrative block of JNU is filled with passionate students. They cheer loudly as a speaker climbs on to a stage. Slogans like ""free Kanhaiya Kumar"" and ""long live revolution"" fill the air as hundreds of visibly agitated students pour into the area. Those gathered here believe that Mr Kumar, the leader of the university's student union, is innocent of the sedition charges levelled against him, and are shocked by the fact that police entered the university to arrest him on Saturday. Police have alleged he organised an event commemorating the hanging of 2001 Parliament attacks convict Afzal Guru, where ""anti-India slogans"" were raised. The students here passionately defend Mr Kumar when I ask them what actually happened at the event. ""We are not terrorists. We are just students and we also condemn anti-India slogans. Our president had nothing to do with those slogans at the event,"" a student tells me. But she refuses to speak on camera. ""I don't want to be seen on camera. I am worried about my safety,"" she says. Student activist Shreya Ghosh speaks of the fear prevailing inside the university. ""We have been sleeping in different rooms every night to avoid arrest,"" she says. Another student activist Deepshita claims that ideological politics lies at the heart of Mr Kumar's arrest. ""Right-wing students want to increase their foothold in the university and that is why they got him [Mr Kumar] arrested. They feel bolstered because the right-wing BJP party is in power at the centre,"" she says. Professor Rajarshi Dasgupta agrees. It's 3pm and speakers are becoming more ferocious in their attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP party. Among the speakers is Prof Ajith Kanna. ""If Kanhaiya is anti-national, then I am also anti-national,"" he tells the cheering crowd. But he pleads with his students to remain peaceful and not pay attention to rumours. And rumours are not in short supply, flying across the tension filled campus. Among them are that more than 100 armed right-wing activists have entered the campus. I meet right-wing student group Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) member Saurabh Kumar a few blocks away from the protest site. ""The law will decide whether he [Kanhaiya Kumar] is guilty or not but we won't tolerate anti-India activities inside this campus,"" he says. But not everyone is protesting. At one of the student housing facilities, I meet PhD students Bibas Sewa and Bijay Thapa. The two condemn the arrest of Mr Kumar, but agree that the protests have disrupted their studies. Even at a time when politics has gripped JNU, there are some students who just want to get on with their work.",formal

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- I was 14 at the time. Lebanon's civil war was in full flood. One afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood in Beirut. A Lebanese woman and her son run through west Beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces. We ran from school screaming. Forget the book bags, classmates, homework. Just run. Out of breath, my knees giving way, it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter -- a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block. The memory of that terrifying afternoon receded -- until recently. After more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction, the bombings and assassinations have returned to Beirut. Every time I hear of a new explosion, I think of a frightened child sitting in darkness. In 1988, I watched the last throes of Lebanon's civil war firsthand -- and like millions of Lebanese, sad, frustrated and often fearful. See a timeline of Lebanon's recent history » . Now I watch from another continent, but I find those same emotions resurfacing. The conspiracies, the car bombs, the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar. The actors are like shadows from a long gone past. They are grayer perhaps -- those who have avoided assassination. But the cast in Lebanon's tragedy has changed little in two decades. Then, as now, a presidential election is the setting, and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set Lebanon back 20 years. See bios of Lebanon's major players » . In 1988, the president's term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate. Militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building. Compromise was nowhere in sight. The West had abandoned Lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors. Syria had its choice for president; Israel had its own allies -- a foil for growing Muslim radicalism. The country was awash with weapons. In his last act as president, Amin Gemayel named fellow Christian and Army Chief Michel Aoun as prime minister. At a stroke, he shattered the convention that a Muslim hold that position. Muslims refused to serve in the Cabinet and the country ended up with two governments. Aoun famously declared: ""I am prime minister and six ministers in one."" Aoun's ""War of Liberation"" against Syria turned into defeat. Then, he turned on fellow Christians of the Lebanese Forces in the ""War of Elimination."" When that failed, the Syrians drove Aoun to take refuge at the French Embassy. In August 1990, I came to CNN as a World Report panelist. I tried to explain Lebanon's chaos, the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians. I had seen people killed in front of me; children orphaned in seconds, parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins. So when I was offered the opportunity to stay at CNN, I gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy. But almost as I left, the civil war was being laid to rest. The various factions had fought each other to a standstill; Arab governments, supported by the West, helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by Syrian influence. Peace came to Lebanon, but it would be five years before I returned. In 1995, I went back and was stunned. I kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants. I couldn't believe that I could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another. No longer did identity -- Christian, Muslim or Druze -- define where Lebanese could go. People mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubble-bubble, laughing at the same jokes. It was as if Lebanon's divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser. Downtown Beirut, once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes, was rocking to Lebanese pop music. The dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest European fashions and deluxe hotels. Lovers had returned to Beirut's Corniche, overlooking the Mediterranean, for romantic strolls at sunset. But the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement -- and was overseen by a ""pax Syriana."" As anti-Syrian sentiment grew, so did political tensions. On Valentine's Day 2005, the Corniche was once again rocked by an explosion. Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed. The symbolism left me speechless. On the day of love, Lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history. It had been widely expected that Hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of Syrian troops. Suspicion fell on Damascus, which vehemently denied involvement. On March 14, Martyrs' Square became a human sea of demonstrators: Muslims, Druze and Christians alike, demanding the ""truth."" But Hariri's death also exposed the fault lines that had broken Lebanon a generation previously. Even after it withdrew its troops, Syria still had allies in Lebanon. One was Hezbollah, accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of U.S. Marines in Beirut more than 20 years previously. Another was Gen. Michel Aoun; now back from exile, the same Michel Aoun who had defied Syria in 1989, but who now made common cause with Hezbollah against his fellow Christians. Earlier this year I visited Martyrs' Square. The spirit of the Cedar Revolution had evaporated. The place looked like a morgue. Anti-government Hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill. As I passed through, business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair. I wondered if they sensed my disappointment, my pain at watching Beirut bleed again. Lebanon's political actors now find themselves re-enacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago. Once again, the term of the president is approaching its end; there is no agreement on his successor. Suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day. And the questions haunts me: Will the country's brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries? E-mail to a friend .

"COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1913/2006 of 20 December 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture and amending certain regulations THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof, Whereas: (1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture (2) has been substantively amended since its adoption. Moreover, the provisions on compensation relating to appreciable revaluations and to reductions in the exchange rates applied to direct aid are now obsolete under Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 2799/98. In the interests of clarity and simplification, Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation. (2) The operative events for the exchange rates applicable to the different situations which arise within the framework of agricultural legislation must be laid down, without prejudice to any specific definitions or exemptions provided for in the rules for the sectors concerned on the basis of the criteria mentioned in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2799/98. (3) For all the prices or amounts to be determined within the framework of trade with third countries, acceptance of the customs declaration is the operative event most suited to achieving the commercial objective concerned. The same applies to export refunds and to the determination of the entry price of fruit and vegetables into the Community, on the basis of which products are classed in the Common Customs Tariff. This operative event should therefore be adopted. (4) The entry price of fruit and vegetables into the Community is determined on the basis of the standard import value of fruit and vegetables referred to in Article 4(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 of 21 December 1994 on detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables (3). Representative prices on the import markets are used to calculate that standard amount. The operative event for the exchange rate for those prices should be determined on the date on which they apply. (5) For production refunds, the operative event for the exchange rate is as a general rule linked to the completion of certain specific formalities. In order to harmonise the rules, it should be laid down that the operative event is the date on which products are declared to have reached the required destination, where such a destination is required, and in all other cases the acceptance of the application for payment of the refund by the paying agency. (6) In the case of the aid for processing citrus fruits and fruit and vegetables referred to in Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 of 28 October 1996 introducing a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits (4) and in Articles 2 and 6a(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products (5) respectively, for the minimum price referred to in Article 6a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96, and for the aid for dried fodder referred to in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1786/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in dried fodder (6), the commercial objective is attained when the products are taken over by the processor. The operative event for the exchange rate should therefore be determined on this basis. (7) For aid granted by quantity of product marketed or to be used in a specific way, the obligation to be complied with for the purposes of granting the aid is an event that guarantees the appropriate use of the products in question. The taking over of the products by the operator concerned is a prerequisite allowing the competent authorities to carry out the required checks or inspections on the operator’s accounts and guaranteeing uniform treatment of the files. The operative event for the exchange rate should therefore be established in relation to the taking over of the products. (8) For other aid granted in the agricultural sector, situations may differ widely. However, such aid is always granted on the basis of an application and within deadlines laid down by the legislation. The operative event for the exchange rate in this case should therefore be established as the deadline for the submission of applications. (9) In the case of the support schemes listed in Annex I to and Article 12 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (7), the operative event for the exchange rate is defined by Article 45 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (8). Reference should be made to this provision. (10) In the case of the prices, premiums and aid in the wine sector provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine (9), the operative event for the exchange rate must be linked, depending on the case, to the starting date of the wine year, the application of specific contracts or the completion of certain operations such as the enrichment or processing of wine products. The operative event to be taken into account should therefore be specified for each situation. (11) The situations to be taken into account for the purposes of determining the operative event are very different for the aid in the milk and milk products sector referred to in Article 1(b)(i), (ii) and (iii) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 of 9 November 2005 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards measures for the disposal of cream, butter and concentrated butter on the Community market (10), in Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999 of 17 December 1999 laying down detailed rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the grant of aid for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder intended for animal feed and the sale of such skimmed-milk powder (11), in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2707/2000 of 11 December 2000 laying down rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards Community aid for supplying milk and certain milk products to pupils in educational establishments (12), in Article 2(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2921/90 of 10 October 1990 on aid for the production of casein and caseinates from skimmed milk (13) and for the levy referred to in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 595/2004 of 30 March 2004 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 establishing a levy in the milk and milk products sector (14). The operative event should therefore be laid down in accordance with the specific nature of each of these situations. (12) In the case of the transport costs referred to in Article 19(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999 of 16 December 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards intervention on the market in butter and cream (15) and in Article 11(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 214/2001 of 12 January 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1786/2003 as regards intervention on the market in skimmed-milk powder (16), the operative event for the exchange rate must be based on the date of submission of tenders under public contracts. This operative event should therefore be established as the date on which an admissible tender has been received by the competent authority for the corresponding transport contract. (13) The reference price for sugar and the minimum price for quota beet referred to in Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (17) are closely linked and should be known to operators for an entire marketing year. The same should apply for the one-off amount levied on the additional sugar quotas and on the supplementary isoglucose quotas, and to the surplus amount and the production charge referred to in Articles 8(3), 9(3), 15 and 16 respectively of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. The operative event for the exchange rate for these prices and amounts should therefore be established as close as possible but prior to the date of harvest. (14) In the case of amounts of a structural or environmental character as referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (18), and amounts approved in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) (19), the payments of which are assured by the rural development programmes approved under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, the amounts are laid down for a marketing year or a calendar year. The commercial objective is therefore attained if the operative event for the exchange rate is established for the year concerned. Based on this, the operative event should be set at 1 January of the year in which the decision to grant aid is taken. (15) The lump sums referred to in point 3 of Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1433/2003 of 11 August 2003 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards operational funds, operational programmes and financial assistance (20), intended to cover overheads specifically related to the operational funds or programmes referred to in Articles 15 and 16 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables (21), are determined for a given year. The operative event for the exchange rate should therefore be set at 1 January of the year to which these overheads relate. (16) For other prices and amounts linked to those prices, the commercial objective is attained on entry into force of the legal act on the basis of which those prices and amounts are determined. However, the operative event for the exchange rate must also correlate with the accounting and reporting obligations of operators and the Member States. Consequently, to allow simplification of management, a single operative event should be established for all prices and amounts relating to a certain type of operation taking place within a given period, provided that they are not too removed from the commercial objective, and the first day of the month in which the legal acts concerned come into force should be used to this end. (17) In the case of advances and securities, the amounts to be paid or the guaranteed amounts are fixed in euro in accordance with the agricultural legislation and in particular Article 45 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. The exchange rate applicable to these amounts must therefore be close to the date of payment of the advance or the date on which the securities are lodged. If the securities are used, the amount of those securities must also cover all the risks for which they were set up. The operative event for the exchange rate must in these circumstances be defined on the basis either of the day on which the amount of the advance is fixed or the security is lodged, or the date on which these are paid. (18) Under Article 4(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the financing by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) of intervention measures in the form of public storage operations and the accounting of public storage operations by the paying agencies of the Member States (22), without prejudice to the specific rules and operative events provided for in the Annexes to that Regulation or in agricultural legislation, expenditure calculated on the basis of amounts fixed in euro and expenditure or revenue incurred in national currency under that Regulation are converted as the case may be into national currency or into euro on the basis of the last exchange rate established by the European Central Bank before the accounting year during which the operations are recorded in the accounts of the paying agency, and that exchange rate also applies to bookings relating to the different specific cases referred to in Article 7(1) of that Regulation. Reference should therefore be made to that provision. (19) The establishment, by Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, of a single operative event for all direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, has rendered obsolete or contradictory certain operative events provided for in the sectoral agricultural legislation, in particular Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1003/81 of 10 April 1981 defining the operative event in the case of the sale of cereals and rice held in store by intervention agencies (23), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3749/86 of 9 December 1986 determining the operative event for calculating levies and refunds in the rice sector (24), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1713/93 of 30 June 1993 establishing special detailed rules for applying the agricultural conversion rate in the sugar sector (25), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1718/93 of 30 June 1993 regarding the operative event for the agricultural conversion rates used in the seeds sector (26), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1756/93 of 30 June 1993 fixing the operative events for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to milk and milk products (27), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1759/93 of 1 July 1993 concerning the operative events determining the agricultural conversion rates to be applied in the beef and veal sector (28), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1785/93 of 30 June 1993 on the operative events for the agricultural conversion rates used in the fibre sector (29), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1793/93 of 30 June 1993 regarding the operative event for the agricultural conversion rates used in the hops sector (30), Commission Regulation (EC) No 3498/93 of 20 December 1993 determining the operative events applicable specifically to the olive oil sector (31), Commission Regulation (EC) No 594/2004 of 30 March 2004 determining the operative events applicable to products in the fruit and vegetables sector and to processed fruit and vegetable products (32) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 383/2005 of 7 March 2005 determining the operative events for the exchange rates applicable to the products of the wine sector (33). (20) Regulations (EEC) Nos 1003/81, 3749/86, 1713/93, 1718/93, 1756/93, 1759/93, 1785/93, 1793/93 and (EC) Nos 3498/93, 594/2004 and 383/2005 should therefore be repealed.

(22) Provision should also be made for a transitional period in the sugar sector, as regards the exchange rate applicable to the minimum price for beet, in view of the contracts signed to this end between beet growers and sugar producers for the 2006/07 marketing year which are currently being implemented. (23) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the relevant Management Committees, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER I OPERATIVE EVENTS FOR THE EXCHANGE RATE Article 1 Export refunds and trade with third countries 1.

"COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 109l(4), third sentence thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), Having regard to the opinion of the European Monetary Institute (2), Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (3), (1) Whereas this Regulation defines monetary law provisions of the Member States which have adopted the euro; whereas provisions on continuity of contracts, the replacement of references to the ecu in legal instruments by references to the euro and rounding have already been laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 of 17 June 1997 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro (4); whereas the introduction of the euro concerns day-to-day operations of the whole population in participating Member States; whereas measures other than those in this Regulation and in Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 should be examined to ensure a balanced changeover, in particular for consumers; (2) Whereas, at the meeting of the European Council in Madrid on 15 and 16 December 1995, the decision was taken that the term 'ecu` used by the Treaty to refer to the European currency unit is a generic term; whereas the Governments of the 15 Member States have reached the common agreement that this decision is the agreed and definitive interpretation of the relevant Treaty provisions; whereas the name given to the European currency shall be the 'euro`; whereas the euro as the currency of the participating Member States shall be divided into one hundred sub-units with the name 'cent`; whereas the definition of the name 'cent` does not prevent the use of variants of this term in common usage in the Member States; whereas the European Council furthermore considered that the name of the single currency must be the same in all the official languages of the European Union, taking into account the existence of different alphabets; (3) Whereas the Council when acting in accordance with the third sentence of Article 109l(4) of the Treaty shall take the measures necessary for the rapid introduction of the euro other than the adoption of the conversion rates; (4) Whereas whenever under Article 109k(2) of the Treaty a Member State becomes a participating Member State, the Council shall according to Article 109l(5) of the Treaty take the other measures necessary for the rapid introduction of the euro as the single currency of this Member State; (5) Whereas according to the first sentence of Article 109l(4) of the Treaty the Council shall at the starting date of the third stage adopt the conversion rates at which the currencies of the participating Member States shall be irrevocably fixed and at which irrevocably fixed rate the euro shall be substituted for these currencies; (6) Whereas given the absence of exchange rate risk either between the euro unit and the national currency units or between these national currency units, legislative provisions should be interpreted accordingly; (7) Whereas the term 'contract` used for the definition of legal instruments is meant to include all types of contracts, irrespective of the way in which they are concluded; (8) Whereas in order to prepare a smooth changeover to the euro a transitional period is needed between the substitution of the euro for the currencies of the participating Member States and the introduction of euro banknotes and coins; whereas during this period the national currency units will be defined as sub-divisions of the euro; whereas thereby a legal equivalence is established between the euro unit and the national currency units; (9) Whereas in accordance with Article 109g of the Treaty and with Regulation (EC) No 1103/97, the euro will replace the ECU as from 1 January 1999 as the unit of account of the institutions of the European Communities; whereas the euro should also be the unit of account of the European Central Bank (ECB) and of the central banks of the participating Member States; whereas, in line with the Madrid conclusions, monetary policy operations will be carried out in the euro unit by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB); whereas this does not prevent national central banks from keeping accounts in their national currency unit during the transitional period, in particular for their staff and for public administrations; (10) Whereas each participating Member State may allow the full use of the euro unit in its territory during the transitional period; (11) Whereas during the transitional period contracts, national laws and other legal instruments can be drawn up validly in the euro unit or in the national currency unit; whereas during this period, nothing in this Regulation should affect the validity of any reference to a national currency unit in any legal instrument; (12) Whereas, unless agreed otherwise, economic agents have to respect the denomination of a legal instrument in the performance of all acts to be carried out under that instrument; (13) Whereas the euro unit and the national currency units are units of the same currency; whereas it should be ensured that payments inside a participating Member State by crediting an account can be made either in the euro unit or the respective national currency unit; whereas the provisions on payments by crediting an account should also apply to those cross-border payments, which are denominated in the euro unit or the national currency unit of the account of the creditor; whereas it is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of payment systems by laying down provisions dealing with the crediting of accounts by payment instruments credited through those systems; whereas the provisions on payments by crediting an account should not imply that financial intermediaries are obliged to make available either other payment facilities or products denominated in any particular unit of the euro; whereas the provisions on payments by crediting an account do not prohibit financial intermediaries from coordinating the introduction of payment facilities denominated in the euro unit which rely on a common technical infrastructure during the transitional period; (14) Whereas in accordance with the conclusions reached by the European Council at its meeting held in Madrid, new tradeable public debt will be issued in the euro unit by the participating Member States as from 1 January 1999; whereas it is desirable to allow issuers of debt to redenominate outstanding debt in the euro unit; whereas the provisions on redenomination should be such that they can also be applied in the jurisdictions of third countries; whereas issuers should be enabled to redenominate outstanding debt if the debt is denominated in a national currency unit of a Member State which has redenominated part or all of the outstanding debt of its general government; whereas these provisions do not address the introduction of additional measures to amend the terms of outstanding debt to alter, among other things, the nominal amount of outstanding debt, these being matters subject to relevant national law; whereas it is desirable to allow Member States to take appropriate measures for changing the unit of account of the operating procedures of organised markets; (15) Whereas further action at the Community level may also be necessary to clarify the effect of the introduction of the euro on the application of existing provisions of Community law, in particular concerning netting, set-off and techniques of similar effect; (16) Whereas any obligation to use the euro unit can only be imposed on the basis of Community legislation; whereas in transactions with the public sector participating Member States may allow the use of the euro unit; whereas in accordance with the reference scenario decided by the European Council at its meeting held in Madrid, the Community legislation laying down the time frame for the generalisation of the use of the euro unit might leave some freedom to individual Member States; (17) Whereas in accordance with Article 105a of the Treaty the Council may adopt measures to harmonise the denominations and technical specifications of all coins; (18) Whereas banknotes and coins need adequate protection against counterfeiting; (19) Whereas banknotes and coins denominated in the national currency units lose their status of legal tender at the latest six months after the end of the transitional period; whereas limitations on payments in notes and coins, established by Member States for public reasons, are not incompatible with the status of legal tender of euro banknotes and coins, provided that other lawful means for the settlement of monetary debts are available; (20) Whereas as from the end of the transitional period references in legal instruments existing at the end of the transitional period will have to be read as references to the euro unit according to the respective conversion rates; whereas a physical redenomination of existing legal instruments is therefore not necessary to achieve this result; whereas the rounding rules defined in Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 shall also apply to the conversions to be made at the end of the transitional period or after the transitional period; whereas for reasons of clarity it may be desirable that the physical redenomination will take place as soon as appropriate; (21) Whereas paragraph 2 of Protocol 11 on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland stipulates that, inter alia, paragraph 5 of that Protocol shall have effect if the United Kingdom notifies the Council that it does not intend to move to the third stage; whereas the United Kingdom gave notice to the Council on 30 October 1997 that it does not intend to move to the third stage; whereas paragraph 5 stipulates that, inter alia, Article 109l(4) of the Treaty shall not apply to the United Kingdom; (22) Whereas Denmark, referring to paragraph 1 of Protocol 12 on certain provisions relating to Denmark has notified, in the context of the Edinburgh decision of 12 December 1992, that it will not participate in the third stage; whereas, therefore, in accordance with paragraph 2 of the said Protocol, all Articles and provisions of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB referring to a derogation shall be applicable to Denmark; (23) Whereas, in accordance with Article 109l(4) of the Treaty, the single currency will be introduced only in the Member States without a derogation; (24) Whereas this Regulation, therefore, shall be applicable pursuant to Article 189 of the Treaty, subject to Protocols 11 and 12 and Article 109k(1), HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: PART I DEFINITIONS Article 1 For the purpose of this Regulation: - 'participating Member States` shall mean Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland, - 'legal instruments` shall mean legislative and statutory provisions, acts of administration, judicial decisions, contracts, unilateral legal acts, payment instruments other than banknotes and coins, and other instruments with legal effect, - 'conversion rate` shall mean the irrevocably fixed conversion rate adopted for the currency of each participating Member State by the Council according to the first sentence of Article 109l(4) of the Treaty, - 'euro unit` shall mean the currency unit as referred to in the second sentence of Article 2, - 'national currency units` shall mean the units of the currencies of participating Member States, as those units are defined on the day before the start of the third stage of economic and monetary union, - 'transitional period` shall mean the period beginning on 1 January 1999 and ending on 31 December 2001, - 'redenominate` shall mean changing the unit in which the amount of outstanding debt is stated from a national currency unit to the euro unit, as defined in Article 2, but which does not have through the act of redenomination the effect of altering any other term of the debt, this being a matter subject to relevant national law.

The currency unit shall be one euro. One euro shall be divided into one hundred cent.

Article 8 1. Acts to be performed under legal instruments stipulating the use of or denominated in a national currency unit shall be performed in that national currency unit. Acts to be performed under legal instruments stipulating the use of or denominated in the euro unit shall be performed in that unit. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 are subject to anything which parties may have agreed. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, any amount denominated either in the euro unit or in the national currency unit of a given participating Member State and payable within that Member State by crediting an account of the creditor, can be paid by the debtor either in the euro unit or in that national currency unit. The amount shall be credited to the account of the creditor in the denomination of his account, with any conversion being effected at the conversion rates. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, each participating Member State may take measures which may be necessary in order to: - redenominate in the euro unit outstanding debt issued by that Member State's general government, as defined in the European system of integrated accounts, denominated in its national currency unit and issued under its own law. If a Member State has taken such a measure, issuers may redenominate in the euro unit debt denominated in that Member State's national currency unit unless redenomination is expressly excluded by the terms of the contract; this provision shall apply to debt issued by the general government of a Member State as well as to bonds and other forms of securitised debt negotiable in the capital markets, and to money market instruments, issued by other debtors, - enable the change of the unit of account of their operating procedures from a national currency unit to the euro unit by: (a) markets for the regular exchange, clearing and settlement of any instrument listed in section B of the Annex to Council Directive 93/22/EEC of 10 May 1993 on investment services in the securities field (5) and of commodities; and (b) systems for the regular exchange, clearing and settlement of payments. 5. Provisions other than those of paragraph 4 imposing the use of the euro unit may only be adopted by the participating Member States in accordance with any time-frame laid down by Community legislation. 6.

"The South African was the fastest qualifier for Saturday's final with a time of one minute 57.67 seconds. ""Caster Semenya is one of the contenders,"" Mutola, who won the 800m Olympic title at the 2000 Olympics, told BBC Africa. ""Pamela Jelimo from Kenya and the Russians are also very, very capable. I'm looking forward to a good final."" Mutola, 39, set the benchmark for women's 800m running until her retirement in 2008, winning three world titles and the Olympic title in Sydney. Semenya, who won the 800m title at the 2009 World Championships, asked her ""idol"" Mutola to be her coach at the end of last year with the sole purpose of helping her win Olympic gold. The 21-year-old looked comfortable in the semi-finals, producing a burst of speed down the back straight to move to the front of the pack and take the line two metres clear of her rivals. ""In 800m you need to be able to run a fast race, and you need to be able to win a tactical slow race,"" explained Mutola, who is in London to fine-tune Semenya's preparations. ""You [need to] combine those two things - so if the race is slow you can win anyway and if the race is fast then it's even better, [as in] the final they'll have to dip under two minutes. ""Since I've got here I've focused more on my athlete Caster Semenya as I know she has to do well, so I'm just enjoying being a coach for the first time."" Semenya became global news when she was asked to take a gender test by athletics' governing body the International Association of Athletics Federations in the aftermath of winning her world title. Doubts were raised over her gender because of her muscular physique, running style and sudden improvement in times. Semenya was suspended for 11 months by the IAAF but was cleared to return to the track in July 2010. She won silver at last year's World Championships in Daegu despite a back problem.",formal

"PARIS, France -- France lock Sebastien Chabal has been cited for a dangerous tackle on England's Simon Shaw during Saturday's World Cup semifinal in Paris. Simon Shaw offloads despite being tackled by Raphael Ibanez, left, and Sebastien Chabal. The Sale Sharks forward will face a disciplinary hearing on Monday after his tackle on opposite second-rower Shaw was noted by citing commissioner Dennis Wheelahan. Chabal started the match on the substitutes' bench, but was brought on in the 26th minute to replace the injured Fabien Pelous during hosts France's 14-9 defeat. If he is suspended, then Chabal will miss Friday's third and fourth-place play-off match at the Parc des Princes. Meanwhile, France coach Bernard Laporte said that the defeat was tougher to take than England's 24-7 win in the 2003 semifinals. ""In 2003, they were better then us. In fact they were better than everyone,"" said Laporte, who is leaving his role to take up the post of junior sports minister in the French government. ""They were like the New Zealand of this tournament - the favorite, except they went all the way. This time it's harder because yesterday it was 50-50."" Meanwhile, England -- seeking to become the first nation to defend the World Cup title -- revealed that star kicker Jonny Wilkinson again had problems with the match balls during the semifinal. The fly-half, who voiced his concerns after struggling with the boot against Australia, rejected a ball before kicking a vital three-pointer against France. ""We didn't say it last week but a non-match ball got onto the field in Marseille which Jonny kicked,"" director of rugby Rob Andrew said. ""He didn't think about it while he was kicking it. ""The match balls are marked, numbered one to six. Last night they had 'World Cup semi-final England vs France' written on them. On match night, Jonny was vigilant when kicking for goal that they were actually match balls he was kicking. ""The practice balls lose pressure and shape. The whole issue last week, the organizers accepted all six match balls should be used by both sides on the Thursday before game."" E-mail to a friend .",formal
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Previously unseen footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death. The footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate ""one way or the other"" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear ""intimate"" details of her personal life. Watch footage of Diana's last hours » . Baker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory. On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. The jury is set to hear ""scene setting"" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. Fayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family ""could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England,"" referring to Diana's son Prince William. ""I'm hoping for justice,"" Al Fayed said outside court. ""At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family."" Baker told the jury of Al Fayed's allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt. ""You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths,"" Baker said, according to inquest transcripts. ""The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died."" Diana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris. They were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor. Next week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident. In its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident. One is a closeup -- looking into the front of the vehicle -- that shows Diana, Fayed, Paul and Rees-Jones minutes before the crash. E-mail to a friend .",formal

In pictures: Great Barrier Reef Vinegar could help save Barrier Reef The taskforce's survey shows that the extent of the damage is most severe in the northern section of the 2,300km (1,429 mile)-long reef, which lies off the coast of Queensland state. Only 7% of the reef showed no signs of bleaching, Prof Hughes said. The effects of El Nino, as well as climate change, are being blamed for the rise in sea temperatures that causes the bleaching. More than 900 individual reefs were surveyed using a light plane and a helicopter, with the accuracy of the aerial survey then checked by teams of scuba divers. ""I'm inherently an optimist, but I think we have a rapidly narrowing window of opportunity to save the Great Barrier Reef,"" Prof Hughes said. ""If we don't take action on global warming it will become more degraded. ""After three bleaching events the mix of coral species has already changed."" This bleaching event is far more severe than previous bleaching events recorded in 2002 and 1998, he said. ""We know that this time only 7% of the reef didn't bleach. It was closer to 40% in the other two events. ""If these events start coming as frequently as every five to 10 years there will not be sufficient coral regeneration,"" he said. Tourism to the Great Barrier Reef generates $A5bn ($3.9b, Â£2.7bn) each year and employs around 70,000 people, the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce said. ""Thankfully many parts of the reef are still in excellent shape,"" said Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council in a statement. ""But we can't just ignore coral bleaching and hope for a swift recovery."" The current worldwide bleaching event, which is also affecting reefs on Australia's north-west coast, is predicted to be the worst on record. The Australian Department of Environment previously said that state and federal governments were investing a projected A$2bn over the next decade to protect the reef.",formal
"Hywel Dda University Health Board wants to reduce the hours of the paediatric ambulatory care unit (PACU) at Withybush Hospital by four hours a day. It is making a recommendation in response to there being ""fewer consultant paediatricians available."" The plans will be discussed at a full health board meeting on 24 November. The PACU cares for children who experience sudden pain, high temperatures, sickness, infections, or requirements for dressings, blood tests, x-rays or scans. If the recommendation is accepted, it would mean the PACU would be open daily from 10:00 to 1800 GMT instead of 10:00 to 22:00. Sick children who require assessment after the new closing time would be referred or transferred by ambulance to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen. The health board said the move to reduce hours in the short term was the result of ""longstanding difficulties in recruiting paediatric consultants across the UK"". This coincided with the retirement of a Pembrokeshire paediatric consultant and the maternity leave of another. The health board said to do nothing would be a ""risk."" There is also a recommendation to merge the on-call rota with the one operating in Carmarthenshire. This means that if there was a paediatric out-of-hours emergency at Withybush Hospital, the on-call paediatric consultants would offer remote advice. The health board's chief executive Steve Moore said: ""It is our duty to be realistic about the availability of our consultants and to plan care around this so that it is safe, consistent and to avoid public confusion. ""Otherwise, we risk the event of having insufficient staff and having to close the unit in an unplanned and uncoordinated way, risking patient safety and public confidence."" He added that the health board's recruitment efforts are continuing.",formal

"(CNN) -- Behind the state banquet and smiles from Queen Elizabeth and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia's visit to London this week caused a wave of dissent. The UK political elite boycotted events. Demonstrators lined the Mall. The UK foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi counterpart to be with his new adopted son. And just days before he arrived, the Saudi King accused British officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in London on July 2005. Whether the politics of the event were a success is open to debate. But this was just part of the story. The Saudis were also in town to cement a strong trading and business relationship that has developed between the two Kingdoms over the last 20 years. Saudi Arabia is the UK's largest trading partner in the Middle East. And behind the USA, the UK is the second largest foreign investor in the Kingdom. UK Trade & Investment has designated Saudi Arabia one of its 17 ""High Growth Markets"" along with UAE and Qatar in the region. As the nation diversifies its economy away from oil, commercial opportunities for UK thrive in a variety of sectors. Saudi Arabia is currently planning six privately-developed economic cities. The $26.6 billion King Abdullah Economic City -- the largest of these -- will create one million jobs and home to two million residents. The aim, says the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, is to boost the economy by creating a pro-business environment, and attracting investors and fostering investment opportunities. The UK has, since the early 1990s, been one of the top five exporters to Saudi Arabia, behind USA, Germany, China and Japan. In 2007, Saudi Arabian bank SABB predicts that UK exports to the Kingdom will increase by more than 5.5 per cent to reach $2.8 billion. While the balance of trade continues to be favor of the British, Saudi Arabia's exports to Britain are also gaining ground and closing the trade gap. This year, exports to Britain are expected to reach a record high of $2.1 billion, says SABB. And this isn't all about oil. In the 1980s, three quarters of Saudi exports to the UK were from oil, but today the non-oil sector accounts for 59 percent of exports. Products being shipped to the UK include machinery, transport equipment, plastics, non-metallic minerals and, despite the UK's dominance in the sector, chemicals. According to SABB, there are also more than 150 Saudi-British joint ventures underway with a value of around $15 billion. As John Sfakianakis, chief economist from SABB says, state visits such as this are important for bolstering trade talks, past and future. ""The biggest deal that will mark their relationship in trade is the purchase of 72 Eurofighter Typhoon Jets that was sealed last week,"" says Sfakianakis. The contract between the Kingdom and the UK Ministry of Defence via BAE is worth over almost $10 billion for the aircraft alone and a further $19 billion for the deployment, maintenance and training. This comes less than a year after the UK government decided to call off a Serious Fraud Office investigation into defense contracts with Saudi Arabia. This probe related to the sale of weapons by BAE Systems to Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. BAE has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and making payments to Saudi royals to win business. But as Sfakianakis points out, any political sensitivity surrounding the visit is unlikely to harm future trading relationships between the nations. ""The relationship is far deeper than that,"" he says. ""Saudi Arabia's economy is booming and the opportunities businessmen see here are immense. Everything else takes a subsidiary part in that.""

"Funerals have been held across the country for those whose bodies were released by forensic investigators. Officials said the number of dead had risen to 358 after two badly burned victims died in hospital. Honduran President Porfirio Lobo has ordered a safety review of all prisons as experts try to establish the causes of the blaze in the Comayagua prison. Pathologists continue to try to identify the bodies of the victims, but said many were so badly burned they could only be identified through DNA testing. So far, only 18 bodies have been released to their families for burial. Deadly conditions Of the 358 people who died, all but one were inmates. The other was the wife of a prisoner who had come to visit her husband. Forensic experts from Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico have joined their Honduran colleagues to try to speed up the identification process. The United States has sent a team from its Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to help with the investigation into the causes of the fire. ATF team member Jose Oquendo said they would stay ""until the investigation is concluded, however long that may take"". The Honduran Ministry of Public Affairs said there had been 852 people inside the prison when the fire broke out on Tuesday.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran should be allowed to pursue its nuclear program for peaceful purposes, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday during the first visit to the country by a Kremlin leader since 1943. Putin, right, is greeted by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad following his arrival in Tehran. Putin, who is in Tehran to attend a summit of Caspian Sea nations, said that he and the other leaders agreed that ""peaceful nuclear activities must be allowed"" in the region. ""The Iranians are cooperating with Russian nuclear agencies and the main objectives are peaceful objectives,"" he said. Russia is building Iran's first nuclear power plant and has resisted moves by the U.S. and its allies to impose stronger U.N. sanctions against Tehran. On Monday, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated the Bush administration's stance that ""all options"" must be kept ""on the table"" in confronting the threats posed by Iran -- a reference to the option of using military action against the long-time U.S. adversary. ""We should have no illusions about the nature of this regime or its leaders -- about their designs for their nuclear program, their willingness to live up to their rhetoric, their intentions for Iraq, or their ambitions in the Gulf region,"" Gates said in a speech to the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs. The leaders of Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also met Tuesday to reach agreement on issues relating to the sharing and regulating of the Caspian Sea -- the world's largest inland body of water. Speaking afterwards, Putin said that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third parties intent on military action against other countries in the region -- a reference to rumors that the U.S. planned to use Azerbaijan as a base for a possible attack against Iran, The Associated Press reported. ""We are saying that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third powers for use of force or military aggression against any Caspian state,"" Putin said. ""The Caspian Sea is an inland sea and it only belongs to the Caspian states, therefore only they are entitled to have their ships and military forces here,"" added Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Putin, defying reports of an assassination plot against him, was greeted by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as he stepped off his plane at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport. During a news conference Monday after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Wiesbaden, Germany, Putin said rumors of an attempt on his life would not stop his plans. ""Of course I will travel to Iran,"" Putin said. ""If I reacted to these kinds of rumors every time, I could never leave the house."" Iranian officials denied there was an assassination plot against Putin, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman describing rumors of a possible terrorist action during the Putin visit baseless. ""Spreading this kind of totally false news lacks any value and cannot damage the trend of the prepared programs,"" spokesman Mohammadali Hosseini told the Iranian FARS news agency. Hosseini blamed the rumor on Western media, particularly the U.S. media, saying the report was ""made up by the enemies of relations between Iran and Russia to create a psychological war."" Putin's visit is the first by a leader in the Kremlin to Iran since Joseph Stalin's World War II conference meeting with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. ""Putin's trip to Tehran is a show of Russia's independence in global affairs. Putin, who approaches the end of his term, wants to demonstrate that he wouldn't cave in to the U.S. pressure,"" said Alexander Pikayev, an expert on Iran with Russia's Institute for World Economy and International Relations, in a report carried by AP. Putin's schedule also includes meetings with Ahmadinejad and Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, AP said. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

Top of the list was a London restaurant which owed almost £100,000 to 30 employees. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said all the money owed had been paid back to workers. The list was the largest of its kind since the ""naming and shaming"" scheme was introduced in October 2013. The department said 688 employers in total have been publicly identified for flouting the law, with total arrears of more than £3.5m. Business Minister Margot James said: ""It is not acceptable that some employers fail to pay at least the minimum wage their workers are entitled to. ""So we'll continue to crack down on those who ignore the law, including by naming and shaming them."" Restaurant San Lorenzo in Wimbledon, South West London, owed £99,541.98 to 30 workers, while Premier Recruitment Ltd in Derby owed £34,797.33 to 424 workers. Also on the list were football clubs Blackpool FC and Brighton and Hove Albion, which owed £2,861.64 to one worker. Brighton and Hove Albion said its reputation had been ""unfairly tarnished"" by its inclusion on the list, claiming the case was a ""minor administrative error"" which resulted from being ""over generous"" in paying expenses to someone on work experience two years ago. A spokesman for the club insisted: ""We are one of the few clubs who pays its staff over and above the National Living Wage."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for the ""worst offenders"" to be prosecuted, adding: ""Bosses who try to duck the minimum wage must have nowhere to hide. ""The level of underpayment in some cases is truly eye-watering."" The list comes after the new National Living Wage was introduced in April, requiring employers to pay at least £7.20 an hour to employees aged 25 and over. However, the Living Wage Foundation calculates that a rate of £8.25 per hour is required to meet the cost of living, rising to £9.40 in London. Some employers pay this higher living wage voluntarily. The National Living Wage of £6.70 an hour applies to workers aged 21 to 24, with lower rates for younger people and apprentices. The government's list includes firms that have failed to pay either the minimum wage or the National Living Wage. Conor D'Arcy from think tank the Resolution Foundation backed the government's policy of naming and shaming but added: ""With the number of people on the wage floor set to treble over the next four years, the government will need to strengthen its resources for enforcing both the national minimum wage and the national living wage."" Green Party peer Baroness Jones said: ""The government must introduce a real Living Wage, calculated by the actual cost of living, as called for by the Living Wage Foundation and the Green Party, among others.

"1. ""Für Elise"" Bob Dylan wrote ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" for Joan Baez. Written by: Ludwig van Beethoven . Written for: Some girl probably not named Elise. In fact, as far as most historians can tell, Beethoven didn't even know an Elise. Instead, the song was originally titled ""Bagatelle in A minor"" based on some handwritten notation a Beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music. Further complicating things, Beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written ""for Therese,"" as in Therese Malfatti, one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro. 2. ""Philadelphia Freedom"" Written by: Elton John & Bernie Taupin . Written for: Billie Jean King, as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave Elton. And what a tracksuit it must have been! The 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever, leaving thousands of Hustle enthusiasts wondering just what Billie Jean King had to do with Philadelphia, anyway. Turns out, the song was a reference to King's pro tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms. Prior to 1968, tennis players were all considered ""amateurs"" and weren't eligible to receive prize money. So, if you didn't have the wealth to support yourself, you couldn't play. Billie Jean King fought against those constraints, ultimately founding Professional World Team Tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport. 3. ""Lola"" Written by: The Kinks' Ray Davies . Written for: A transvestite. But the question is, which one? According to Rolling Stone, ""Lola"" was inspired by Candy Darling, a member of Andy Warhol's entourage, whom Ray Davies briefly (and cluelessly) dated. If that's the case, then ""Lola"" is just another notch on Darling's song belt -- she's also referred to in Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side."" (""Candy came from out on the Island/ In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'."") But, in the Kinks' official biography, Davies tells a different story. He says ""Lola"" was written after the band's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him. 4. ""867-5309/Jenny"" Written by: Jim Keller (of Tommy Tutone) and Alex Call . Written for: Unknown, as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they're asked. While the woman continues to remain a mystery, however, the phone number is all too real. In fact, it's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time hasn't quelled of the number of crank calls. In 1999, Brown University freshman roommates Nina Clemente and Jahanaz Mirza found that out the hard way, when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system. Immediately, the girls' innocuous Room No. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish. Other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions, like the holder of 212-867-5309, who put his phone number up for auction on eBay in 2004. Bids approached $100,000 before eBay pulled the item at the request of Verizon, the number's actual owner. 5. ""Oh, Carol"" Written by: Neil Sedaka . Written for: Carole King, naturally. Sedaka and King actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance Sedaka was able to successfully milk with ""Oh, Carol,"" a then top-10 (if now somewhat forgettable) 1959 pop song. However, the real success of ""Oh, Carol"" came a few months later, when it inspired King to write a rebuttal entitled ""Oh, Neil."" At the time, King and her husband, Gerry Goffin, were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune. ""Oh, Neil"" wasn't that, but it did pay off. After Sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss, King and Goffin landed jobs at the legendary Brill Building pop music factory, where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" and ""The Loco-Motion."" 6. ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" Written by: Bob Dylan . Written for: Joan Baez, though it clearly wasn't the nicest gift Dylan could have given her. The two met in 1961, when Baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and Dylan was a nobody from Minnesota. Desperate to make his break in the music biz, Dylan worked like crazy to get Baez's attention. He eventually ended up going on tour with her, which is how he first became famous, and also how the two began dating. For a while, they seemed like the golden couple, but things soon went downhill. During a European concert tour together in early 1965, they had a huge fight and parted ways. That May, Dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus, and Baez, hoping to remain friends, decided to bring him flowers. Sadly, that's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else. That someone else was Sara Lownds, whom Dylan married a mere six months later. 7. ""Our House"" Written by: Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) Written for: Joni Mitchell. In December 1968, Nash and Mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. Though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon, Laurel Canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for San Francisco society -- not just CSN&Y, but also Jim Morrison, the Eagles, Frank Zappa, and more. ""Our House"" was directly inspired by a lazy Sunday in the Nash/Mitchell household. The couple went out to brunch, hit an antiques store, and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly, at which point Nash literally ""lit a fire,"" while Mitchell ""placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day."" No, really. The whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to Nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"I want to say this was about two weeks ago, could be less, but I haven't been sleeping very much lately and the days are starting to blur together. My dream started off quite normal, going to familiar places and seeing people I knew. However, I then went through a door and ended up on the middle of the interstate outside my current hometown, traffic not even bothering to attempt to avoid me. It felt like Frogger. Anyway, I came to the conclusion that I should just walk home to my old house which is about 180 miles from where I live now. The entire way back, I began making up stories to keep myself entertained and somehow came upon the idea of creating a new background for my last name, coming up with traits and their stories for each letter in my last name. Somehow I ended up in my childhood neighborhood in North Carolina, but my house in Florida had replaced the house there. Every light in the neighborhood was off. No streetlamps, no porch lights, the stars and moon were gone as well. Completely dark, and the fatigue was beginning to wear me down. I finally made it to my house and walked in the front door. I expected to hear my dogs barking due to the noise I made, but there was nothing. I walk through the hallway, turn my head to the right and see my parents' bedroom door is closed. I figure they're asleep, so I turn around. As soon as I was facing the opposite direction, I see my sister in a chair, dead, eyes open but lifeless, and fucking Slender Man behind her, and even with his featureless face, I could sense every bit fear-inducing aura built up within him as if he'd done this same thing to thousands of people in their nightmares since the dawn of man. I yelled out her name in the dream, waking myself up with the sound of me actually yelling it in the real world. I shot straight up in my bed, sobbing, yelling out my sister's name as if it were something from a movie. That one nightmare singlehandedly scared me more than anything else in my entire life. TL;DR - Fuck Slender Man.",informal
"I taught this stuff in the AF The reason for this, is that aircraft have a tendency to break at the wing and tail, when they crash. If you are sitting behind the wings, and the craft crashes, it gives you multiple options to egress the plane.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A man has been indicted on federal charges for allegedly displaying hangman's nooses from the back of a pickup truck during a civil rights march last year in Jena, Louisiana. A photo taken by I-Reporter Casanova Love shows a noose hanging from a pickup in Alexandria, Louisiana. Jeremiah Munsen, 18, of Grant Parish, repeatedly drove slowly past a group of marchers gathered at a bus depot in Alexandria, which is near Jena, as they awaited buses to return them to Tennessee, federal authorities said Thursday. As many as 20,000 marchers had taken part in the huge protests in Jena. Authorities there had been accused of injustice in the handling of racially charged cases, including the hanging of nooses in a tree after a group of black high school students sat in an area where traditionally only white students sat. The noose incident at Jena was the beginning of months of racial tension that included the beating of a white student, allegedly by six black classmates. The black students were prosecuted, but the three white students responsible for the nooses in the tree were not. Munsen and an unnamed conspirator had attached nooses to their pickup on September 20 and driven to Alexandria specifically to threaten and intimidate the marchers, the authorities said. View a series of photos of the truck » . A juvenile passenger was apprehended with Munsen, according to the arresting officer's report. The juvenile told police he and his family are in the Ku Klux Klan and that he had ""KKK"" tattooed on his chest, the police report said. He also said that he tied the nooses and that brass knuckles found in the truck belonged to him, the report said. ""This indictment accuses the defendant [Munsen] of conduct that constitutes a federal civil rights conspiracy violation and a federal hate crime,"" said U.S. Attorney Donald Washington. Washington and Grace Chung Becker, acting head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, announced the indictment, issued by a grand jury in Shreveport, Louisiana. A photograph of the truck was sent to CNN by I-Reporter Casanova Love, 26, who said he is in the U.S. military. He was visiting his family in Louisiana and said he witnessed the event. Love added, ""If the police had not stepped in, I fear what might have happened."" E-mail to a friend .",formal
"The 130m-tall (420ft) Bulford Kiwi, on Bulford Hill near Stonehenge, was carved by New Zealand troops who were stationed there. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has made it a scheduled monument on the advice of Historic England. Kiwi soldiers played a significant role in the Battle of Messines, fought in June 1917 in Belgium. Another monument at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, marking the same battle, has also been granted protection. The Terrain Model of Messines - a scale model of the battlefield - was made by German prisoners of war using soil, concrete, bricks and pebbles. The model was a popular tourist attraction at the end of the war, but it became neglected and was lost until it was recently excavated. It has now been covered over again to protect it from damage and erosion. Roger Bowdler from Historic England said: ""These two monuments pay tribute to the bravery of New Zealand's fighting forces in the First World War and we are delighted that they are now being protected for the future. ""The Bulford Kiwi was cut into the chalk at the end of the war by Kiwi soldiers themselves, to mark the presence of their forces in England, and their achievements at the front. ""The taking of the Messines ridge was one of the war's most stirring attacks, and this model lay-out remains as testimony to the planning which made possible the victory. ""Like so much of our historic environment, these lasting reminders enable us to connect with lives and events from the past that made us who we are as a nation. ""One hundred years on, it is right to remember New Zealand's valour."" Sir Jerry Mateparae, New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK said: ""It's fantastic to see Historic England protecting two very significant sites of huge importance for New Zealand. ""The special connections that were forged 100 years ago, with communities in the UK where New Zealanders trained, are still strong today and it's moving to see these sites protected for generations to come.""",formal

"In her resignation letter she said her decision would enable her party to have a ""real discussion"" about its future. Senior party members had ""questioned my place in this new phase"", she said. Earlier, the 56-year-old said some Labour MPs were ""dinosaurs"" who failed to see ""Scotland has changed forever"". Ms Lamont had wanted more autonomy for the party in Scotland and significant new powers for the Scottish Parliament. But in an interview with the Daily Record she accused Westminster colleagues of treating Scotland like a ""branch office"". Labour has 41 MPs in Scotland who will fight for their Westminster seats at next May's General Election. The party also has 38 MSPs in Edinburgh's Holyrood parliament and they will seek re-election in 2016. In her resignation letter to Scottish Labour chairman Jamie Glackin Ms Lamont said the referendum had ""opened a new chapter in the debate about the future of the Scottish Labour Party"". She added: ""In order that we can have the real discussion about how we take Scottish Labour forward, I believe it would be best if I took myself out of the equation and stepped down as leader."" She described Labour's challenge in Scotland as ""serious"", but added ""I strongly believe that the Labour Party is not only our best chance of achieving a better, fairer Scotland, it's our only chance"". There are two versions of this story. In one version, Scottish Labour's departing leader, Johann Lamont, accuses her Westminster colleagues - and, by implication, Ed Miliband - of undermining her and failing to grasp how much Scotland has changed. She says some of her MP colleagues are ""dinosaurs"". The alternative version is that Johann Lamont wasn't up to the job - that she failed to counter the SNP, that she failed to modernise the party sufficiently to cope with a new Scotland where people are no longer prepared to back Labour as a duty, that she failed to attract new talent who might freshen up the party's portrait for the electorate in 2016, when Holyrood goes to the polls. Reacting to news of the resignation, SNP deputy leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Ms Lamont ""carries my personal best wishes"". But she added: ""There is no question that her shock resignation reveals Labour to be in complete meltdown in Scotland."" Ms Sturgeon said: ""The scale of the infighting between Scottish Labour and Labour at Westminster is exposed for all to see."" The timetable for choosing a new leader will be set out soon. In the meantime, deputy leader Anas Sarwar is in charge and an MSP will be chosen to stand in for Ms Lamont at Holyrood. Whoever replaces her will become Scottish Labour's seventh leader since the Scottish Parliament was established 15 years ago. Ms Lamont, a former English teacher who joined the Labour Party as a teenager, has represented the Glasgow Pollok constituency at Holyrood since 1999. She took over as the party's Scottish leader in the aftermath of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, when Labour suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the SNP. In the weeks after the independence referendum, she said she wanted to lead Labour to victory in the next Holyrood election in 2016 and become first minister. Labour leader Ed Miliband said she deserved ""significant credit"" for the successful ""No"" vote in the Scottish referendum campaign. He added: ""She campaigned the length and breadth of Scotland making the case for social justice within the United Kingdom. ""She has led the Scottish Labour Party with determination. I know she will continue to serve her constituents. ""Having elected a new leader, I believe the party will show the same will and determination it did in the referendum campaign to help us to victory in the general election of 2015 and the Scottish elections of 2016."" Former prime minister Gordon Brown has constantly been linked to the job, as has fellow MP Jim Murphy, who also played a prominent role in the referendum campaign. Mr Brown said he was sorry to hear that Ms Lamont had resigned. He added; ""She brought determination, compassion and a down-to-earth approach to the leadership and deserves great credit for taking on the challenge after 2011. ""I wish her well in the future."" Senior Labour sources have indicated that both the former Prime minister, Gordon Brown and the former Scottish Secretary , Jim Murphy, will be approached to see if they are willing to lead the Labour Party in Scotland. If the two men refuse another scenario being canvassed is for a joint ticket between the MP Anas Sarwar and the MSP Kezia Dugdale. Mr Sarwar would be the leader and would seek to improve relations between Westminster and Holyrood. Ms Dugdale would lead the group at Holyrood. One Labour source described this as the ""ideal option"". Others believe Mr Murphy should be encouraged to stand. One figure said that if ""Jim doesn't stand it will be a disaster"", but added he believed the shadow cabinet member could be persuaded.",formal
"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- A key rebel commander and fugitive from a U.S. drug trafficking indictment was killed over the weekend in an air attack on a guerrilla encampment, the Colombian military said Monday. Alleged cocaine trafficker and FARC rebel Tomas Medina Caracas in an Interpol photo. Tomas Medina Caracas, known popularly as ""El Negro Acacio,"" was a member of the high command of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia and, according to Colombian and U.S. officials, helped manage the group's extensive cocaine trafficking network. He had been in the cross-hairs of the U.S. Justice Department since 2002. He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States and manufacturing and distributing cocaine within Colombia to fund the FARC's 42-year insurgency against the government. U.S. officials alleged Medina Caracas managed the rebel group's sales of cocaine to international drug traffickers, who in turn smuggled it into the United States. He was also indicted in the United States along with two other FARC commanders in November 2002 on charges of conspiring to kidnap two U.S. oil workers from neighboring Venezuela in 1997 and holding one of them for nine months until a $1 million ransom was paid. Officials said the army's Rapid Response Force, backed by elements of the Colombian Air Force, tracked Medina Caracas down at a FARC camp in the jungle in the south of the country. ""After a bombardment, the troops occupied the camp, and they've found 14 dead rebels so far, along with rifles, pistols, communications equipment and ... four GPS systems,"" Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said at a news conference. ""The death of 'El Negro Acacio' was confirmed by various sources, including members of FARC itself."" Medina Caracas commanded FARC's 16th Front in the southern departments of Vichada and Guainia. Established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party, FARC is Colombia's oldest, largest, most capable and best-equipped Marxist rebel group, according to the U.S. Department of State.

"SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- You must know what's really driving the immigration debate. It's the culture, stupid. Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Some opponents of immigration, even the legal kind, fear changes in local culture. Immigration restrictionists -- and by that, I mean those who want to limit all immigration, even the legal kind -- like to pretend they're so high-minded. Yet they can't help themselves. They always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants. The restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns: that our borders aren't secure, that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally, and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here. Really? If that's the extent of it, then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on American culture through everything from taco trucks to Spanish-language billboards. That seems to be the issue in North Dakota, where, according to a recent article in USA Today, towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them. In Cooperstown, the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy, because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who? American kids who work at Starbucks? Nope. The article quotes Orville Tranby, a local community leader in Cooperstown, who says that some residents have told him ""face to face"" that such facilities might attract Hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture. You'll find the same fear in Lewisburg, Tennessee. Not long ago, an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in Spanish. Townspeople wanted no part of that. They demanded that all books purchased by the library, or even donated, be in English-only. These stories are ridiculous, but they're also helpful. They illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration, and it goes well beyond words like ""legal"" or ""illegal."" It's the perception that the country is becoming more Hispanic, that Spanish is replacing English, that Hispanic immigrants are weakening American identity, and that Main Street is turning into Little Mexico. A leader of the vigilante Minuteman movement moronically called it the ""colonization"" of the United States. This sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy, that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners, and that our children are going to live in a world where they're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up. It conjures up the alarm bells that Benjamin Franklin set off about German immigrants in the late 18th century, who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the English, but would ""swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours."" It popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that Chinese immigrants were ""unassimilable,"" which led to Congress approving the explicitly-named Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. And it helped welcome the 20th century when Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge warned that immigrants (read: the Irish) were diluting ""the quality of (U.S.) citizenship"" and others complained that Italian immigrants were uneducated, low skilled, apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity. Where have we heard that before? And when will we hear it again? After all, Hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists. But they won't be the last.

"You're missing out on a few key stages, which is crucial to how the law works. When the 999 call is made, by either someone who heard the gunshot, or the homeowner who's defended himself, an ARV (armed response vehicle) **will** be sent out. The guy with the gun, whomever it may be, will be ordered to put the weapon down. If he owns a shotgun/rifle, then there will be a 99% chance that he'll also possess the shotgun certificate or FAC (Firearms certificate) to go along with it. This will be recorded on a database and will enable the police to establish whether he is the legal owner of the firearm very quickly. The police do not have to arrest someone to talk to them. The police will talk to the person who used self defence in the household, be it for a few minutes longer, to establish the basic runthrough of events. If everything checks out, there are witnesses etc, then normally you'll just be asked to go to the station to give a statement, and possibly further questioning. If there are any discrepancies, etc, you'll probably be arrested. tl;dr Establishing identity is an incredible simple process, and if there's any doubt then you'll be arrested.",informal

The complaint contained evidence of dumping of the product concerned and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. (3) The Commission officially advised the complaining Community producers, the other known Community producers, importers and users' associations known to be concerned as well as the known exporting producers and the representatives of Russia and Turkey of the initiation of the proceeding. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation. 2. Sampling (4) In view of the large number of Community producers, importers in the Community not related to an exporting producer in one of the countries concerned and of exporting producers in the countries concerned, it was considered appropriate, in conformity with Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation), to examine whether sampling should be used. In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling would indeed be necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all the above parties were requested, pursuant to Article 17(2) of the basic Regulation, to make themselves known within two weeks of the initiation of the proceeding and to provide the Commission with the information requested in the notice of initiation, for the period from 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002 (the investigation period or IP). (5) All 14 Community producers on behalf of which the complaint had been lodged agreed to be included in the sample and provided the requested information within the deadline. Amongst them, eight companies(4) were selected for the sample. These were found to be representative of the overall complaining Community producers in terms of volume of production and sales of the product concerned in the Community, as well as in terms of geographic coverage. (6) Twelve unrelated importers also agreed to be included in the sample and provided the requested basic information within the deadline. In view of this situation, the Commission services decided not to apply sampling in the case of the unrelated importers, but to send questionnaires to all the 12 aforementioned importers. (7) As far as exporting producers are concerned, only one exporting producer in Russia made itself known within the relevant deadline, and therefore sampling was not applied for Russia. In the case of Turkey however, 19 exporting producers agreed to be included in the sample and provided the requested information within the deadline. From those producers, only 16 actually sold the product concerned in the Community during the investigation period. The choice of the sample was made in consultation with the representatives of the companies and the Turkish authorities. An agreement was reached on a sample of five companies covering around 80 % of the total exports of the product concerned to the Community during the IP. In addition to the above, among the companies which had sales to the Community, six companies not selected in the sample have requested an individual examination. In view of the large number of requests which was even exceeding the number of companies selected in the sample, it was considered that such individual examinations would be unduly burdensome in the sense of Article 17(3) of the basic Regulation and only two requests were granted. 3. Investigation (8) The Commission sent questionnaires to all Community producers having agreed to be included in the sample (a full questionnaire to the eight sampled companies and a small questionnaire limited to certain macro-indicators to the six non-sampled companies, see the injury section below), all unrelated importers that made themselves known within the deadlines set out in the notice of initiation, to the only known exporting producer in Russia as well as all exporting producers in Turkey that have been included in the sample or which have been granted individual examination as well as to 11 associations of companies known to be users of the product under consideration. (9) Replies were received from the eight sampled Community producers, from the six non-sampled Community producers, from six unrelated importers in the Community, one exporting producer in Russia, that also requested market economy treatment (MET), and six exporting producers in Turkey. No reply was received from users. (10) The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of dumping, resulting injury and Community interest. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies: (a) Sampled Community producers - Voestalpine Krems GmbH, Krems/Donau, Austria, - SRW GmbH, Altensteig-Walddorf, Germany, - Arcelor Tubes France SA, Vincey, France, - ILVA SpA, Milano, Italy, - Marcegaglia SpA, Mantova, Italy, - Rautaruukki Oyj Metform, Helsinki, Finland, - Corus UK Ltd, Corby, United Kingdom; (b) Sampled exporting producers in Turkey - Cayirova Boru San Ve Tic AS, Istanbul (related to Yücel Boru Profil Endüstrisi AS), - Yücel Boru Profil Endüstrisi AS, Istanbul (related to Cayirova Boru San Ve Tic AS), - MMZ Onur Boru Profil Uretim, Istanbul, - Ozdemir Sanayi Ve Tic Ltd, Eregli; (c) Exporting producers in Turkey granted individual examination - Noksel Celik Boru Sanayi AS, Ankara, - Guven Boru ve Profil Sanayi ve Ticaret Ltd, Istanbul; (d) Exporting producer in Russia - JSC Severstal, Cherepovets. (11) It should be noted that due to ""force majeure"" reasons, one of the companies initially selected in the sample for Turkey, Toscelik Profil ve Sac, was finally not able to supply all the requested information to the Commission services in due time. Consequently this company was eventually excluded from the sample and was not visited, but was however still considered as cooperating. 4. Investigation period (12) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002 (investigation period or IP). The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 1998 to the end of the investigation period (period considered). B. PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT 1. General (13) Hollow sections consist of welded pipes, tubes and hollow profiles of a square or rectangular cross-section of iron or steel with the exception of those made of stainless steel or of a perimeter greater than 600 mm, currently classifiable within CN codes ex 7306 60 31 (TARIC code 7306 60 31 90 ) and ex 7306 60 39 (TARIC code 7306 60 39 90 ). (14) Hollow sections are produced in a vast range of dimensions, thickness, lengths and steel grades. There are basically two fabrication processes. Hollow sections can be cold or hot formed. Both types are used primarily in the construction industry, although the latter is normally used for more demanding applications (e.g. load-bearing, engineering). Amongst the cold-formed hollow sections, the most common type, the so-called ""structural"" hollow sections, are primarily used in the construction industry, but which may also be found in various applications (e.g. construction, storage, farm equipment, trailers, trucks, earth movers). By opposition, the so-called ""precision"" hollow sections, generally of a smaller size, which are used in end-consumer activities like the automotive industry, office and design furniture, gardening tools and childcare applications. Volume wise, the ""structural"" hollow section is by far the most employed. 2. Product concerned (15) The product concerned is hollow sections originating in Russia and Turkey (the product concerned). (16) The investigation showed that all types of the product concerned, despite differences in the production methods have the same basic physical and technical characteristics and are used for the same purposes. (17) Therefore and for the purpose of the present anti-dumping proceeding all types of the product concerned are provisionally regarded as one product concerned. 3. Like product (18) It is provisionally determined that the hollow sections produced and sold by the Community industry on the Community market are a like product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation to the hollow sections exported to the Community originating in the countries concerned. Similarly, the hollow sections produced and sold in the countries concerned are alike to the hollow sections exported to the Community and originating in the countries concerned. C. DUMPING 1. General methodology (19) The general methodology set out hereinafter has been applied for all exporting producers in Turkey and for the sole cooperating Russian exporting producer, for which MET was granted, as explained under recitals 34 to 39. The presentation of the findings on dumping for each of the countries concerned therefore only describes what is specific for each exporting country. Normal value (20) As far as the determination of normal value is concerned, the Commission first established, for each exporting producer, whether its total domestic sales of the product concerned were representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community. In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, domestic sales were considered representative when the total domestic sales volume of each exporting producer was at least 5 % of its total export sales volume to the Community. (21) The Commission subsequently identified those types of hollow sections, sold domestically by the companies having representative domestic sales and that were identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the Community. (22) For each type sold by the exporting producers on their domestic markets and found to be directly comparable to the type of hollow sections sold for export to the Community, it was established whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. Domestic sales of a particular type of hollow sections were considered sufficiently representative when the total domestic sales volume of that type during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the comparable hollow sections type exported to the Community. (23) An examination was also made as to whether the domestic sales of each hollow sections type could be regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade, by establishing the proportion of profitable sales to independent customers of the hollow sections type in question. In cases where the sales volume of hollow sections type, sold at a net sales price equal to or above the calculated cost of production, represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of that type, and where the weighted average price of that type was equal to or above the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales of that type made during the IP, irrespective of whether these sales were profitable or not. In cases where the volume of profitable sales of hollow sections type represented 80 % or less of the total sales volume of that type, or where the weighted average price of that type was below the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of profitable sales of that type only, provided that these sales represented 10 % or more of the total sales volume of that type. (24) In cases where the volume of profitable sales of any type of hollow sections represented less than 10 % of the total sales volume of that type, it was considered that this particular type was sold in insufficient quantities for the domestic price to provide an appropriate basis for the establishment of the normal value. (25) Wherever domestic prices of a particular type of hollow sections sold by an exporting producer could not be used in order to establish normal value, another method had to be applied. In this regard, the Commission used the prices of the product concerned charged on the domestic market by the other producers, in accordance with Article 2(1) of the basic Regulation. In all cases where this was not possible, constructed normal value was used, in accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation. (26) In all cases where constructed normal value was used and in accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation, normal value was constructed by adding to the manufacturing costs of the exported types, adjusted where necessary, a reasonable percentage for selling, general and administrative expenses (SG& A) and a reasonable margin of profit. In all cases SG& A and profit were established pursuant to the methods set out in Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation. Export price (27) In all cases where the product concerned was exported to independent customers in the Community, the export price was therefore established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, namely on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable. (28) In the case sales were made via a related importer, the export price was constructed on the basis of the resale prices to independent customers. Adjustments were made for all costs incurred between importation and resale by that importer, including SG& A expenses, and a reasonable profit margin, in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation. Comparison (29) For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. Appropriate adjustments were granted in all cases where they were found to be reasonable, accurate and supported by verified evidence. Dumping margin (30) According to Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, for each exporting producer the weighted average normal value was compared with the weighted average export price. (31) For non-cooperating companies, a ""residual"" dumping margin was determined in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available. (32) For those countries where the level of cooperation was high and where there was no reason to believe that any exporting producer abstained from cooperating, it was decided to set the residual dumping margin at the level of the cooperating company with the highest dumping margin, in order to ensure the effectiveness of any measures. (33) In a case where the level of cooperation for one country was low, the residual dumping margin was determined on the basis of the highest dumped export sales to the Community of representative quantities. This approach was also considered necessary in order to avoid giving a bonus for non-cooperation and in view of the fact that there were no indications that a non-cooperating party had dumped at a lower level. 2. Russia Market economy treatment (34) Pursuant to Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation, in anti-dumping investigations concerning imports originating in Russia, normal value shall be determined in accordance with Article 2(1) to 2(6) for those producers which were found to meet the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c), i.e. where it is shown that market economy conditions prevail in respect of the manufacture and sale of the product concerned. (35) Only one Russian company, JSC Severstal, made itself known within the relevant deadlines and requested MET pursuant to Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation by replying to the MET claim for exporting producers. (36) In order to be granted MET, the company concerned had to demonstrate that market economy conditions prevailed for it. (37) The Commission sought all information deemed necessary and verified on the spot all information submitted in the MET applications at the premises of the company in question. (38) It was confirmed that its decisions regarding prices and costs were made without significant state interference within the meaning of Article 2(7)(c) and that costs and prices reflected market values. This company had accounts independently audited in line with international accounting standards and their production costs and financial situation was not subject to significant distortions carried over from the former non-market-economy system. It was also confirmed that the company is subject to bankruptcy and property laws which guarantee legal certainty and stability for the operation of firms and that exchange rate conversions are carried out at the market rate. (39) It was therefore concluded that JSC Severstal fulfils the conditions set out in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation and could therefore be granted the MET. The Advisory Committee was consulted and did not object to the Commission's conclusions. Normal value (40) JSC Severstal was requested to submit a full questionnaire reply including information concerning domestic sales and cost of production of the product concerned. As explained under recital 10, this reply was verified at the premises of the company. (41) The normal value was established as described in recitals 20 to 26, i.e. either on the basis of the prices paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, by independent customers on the domestic market in accordance with Article 2(1) of the basic Regulation or constructed in accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation for the type of the product concerned sold to the Community. Export prices (42) The investigation showed that the exports of the Russian exporting producer were made directly to unrelated customers in the Community and also via a related company located in Switzerland. Therefore, the export price was established according to the methodology explained under recitals 27 and 28, i.e. respectively on the basis of either the export prices actually paid or payable or a constructed export price based on the resale price to the first independent customer in the Community. (43) In the second case, adjustments were made for all relevant costs incurred by the related importer, including SG& A expenses, and a reasonable profit margin, in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation. Comparison (44) The comparison was made on an ex-factory basis and at the same level of trade. In order to ensure a fair comparison, account was taken, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which were claimed and demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability. On this basis, allowances for differences in transport, level of trade, insurance, handling, loading and ancillary costs, credit, commissions and import charges were made. Dumping margin for the cooperating company (45) The weighted average normal value of each type of the product concerned exported to the Community was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type of the product concerned, as provided for under Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation. (46) On this basis, the provisional dumping margin, expressed as a percentage of the cif Community frontier price duty unpaid, is 9,5 %. Residual dumping margin (47) In view of the established high level of cooperation for Russia, around 90 %, and in absence of indication that any exporting producer deliberately abstained from cooperating, the residual dumping margin is set at the level of the margin established for the only cooperating company, i.e. 9,5 % of the cif Community frontier price. 3. Turkey (48) As explained in recitals 4 and 7, and given the large number of exporting producers concerned in Turkey, sampling was applied. The companies selected in the sample are: - Cayirova Boru San Ve Tic AS, Istanbul, - Yücel Boru Profil Endüstrisi AS, Istanbul, - Özdemir Boru Profil San.ve Ticaret AS, Eregli, - Toscelik Profil ve Sac. Endüstrisi AS, Iskenderun, - MMZ Onur Boru Profil Uretim, Istanbul. (49) As mentioned in recital 11, it should be noted that the company Toscelik Profil ve Sac was finally not able to supply all the requested information to the Commission services in due time. Therefore, it was eventually excluded from the sample but, for the reasons set out above in recital 11, was however still considered as cooperating. (50) The following companies were granted individual examination: - Noksel Celik Boru Sanayi AS, Ankara, - Guven Boru ve Profil Sanayi ve Ticaret Ltd, Istanbul. (51) The following companies were not selected but agreed to cooperate: - Goktas Yassi Hadde Mamülleri Sanayi ve Ticaret AS, Gebze-Kocaeli, - Yasan Yassi Metal San. Tic. AS, Istanbul, - Boral Boru Profil San. ve Tic. Ltd, Istanbul, - Umran Celik Boru Sanayii AS, Istanbul, - Borusan Birlesik Boru Fabrikalari AS, Istanbul, - Mannesmann Boru Endustrisi AS, Istanbul, - Erbosan Erciyas Boru Sanayii ve Ticaret AS, Kayseri, - Borutas Boru Sanayii ve Ticaret AS, Adapazari, - Cinar Boru Profil San. Tic. Ltd STI, Eregli, - Sevil Boru-Profil Sanayii ve Ticaret AS, Istanbul, - Özborsan Boru San.ve Ticaret AS, Istanbul. Normal value (52) Given the significant inflation in Turkey, around 45 % in 2002, the Commission established normal value on a monthly basis for those types of the product concerned which were directly comparable to the types of hollow sections exported to the Community. In those cases where there were no sales or no representative sales of comparable types of hollow sections on the domestic market or where monthly domestic sales were not made in the ordinary course of trade, the Commission used the average prices of other exporting producers in the domestic market of the exporting country as a basis for establishing the normal value. Only in cases where the same types of hollow sections were not found in the sales of other exporting producers in the domestic market of the exporting country, normal values were constructed in accordance with Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation. For five cooperating exporting producers, their own cost of manufacturing plus the companies' own SG& A expenses and profits were used. For one company, given that its total domestic sales of the product concerned were not representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community the Commission used the prices of other exporting producers in the domestic market of the exporting country as a basis for establishing the normal value. Export price (53) The export price of products originating in Turkey is based on export sales made directly to independent customers in the Community and is thus established pursuant to Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation. Comparison (54) Adjustments were made for rebates, discounts, transport, handling, charging, discharging costs, ancillary costs (bank charges), insurance and credit costs where appropriate. Dumping margin (55) According to Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, for each exporting producer the monthly weighted average normal value was compared to the monthly weighted average export price. 1. Cooperating exporting producers in the sample and exporting producers granted with an individual examination (56) It is the Commission's standard practice to establish one dumping margin for related exporting producers, in order to preclude the possibility that future exports to the Community might be channelled through the companies having the lower margin. (57) The provisional dumping margins expressed as a percentage of the cif import price at the Community border are: - Özdemir Boru Profil San.ve Ticaret AS, Eregli: 14,7 %, - MMZ Onur Boru Profil Uretim, Istanbul: 14,4 %, - Guven Boru ve Profil Sanayi ve Ticaret Ltd, Istanbul: 6,4 %, - Noksel Celik Boru Sanayi AS, Ankara: 5,3 %, - Yücel Boru Profil Endüstrisi AS, Istanbul: 4,2 %, - Cayirova Boru San Ve Tic AS, Istanbul: 4,2 %. 2. Other cooperating exporting producers not included in the sample (58) In order to establish the dumping margin to be applied to the cooperating Turkish producers not included in the sample, the Commission calculated a weighted average dumping margin for the producers in the sample, as stipulated in Article 9(6) of the basic Regulation. (59) This exercise led to a weighted average dumping margin of 6,4 % for the following companies: - Goktas Yassi Hadde Mamülleri Sanayi ve Ticaret AS, Gebze-Kocaeli, - Yasan Yassi Metal San. Tic. AS, Istanbul, - Boral Boru Profil San. ve Tic. Ltd, Istanbul, - Umran Celik Boru Sanayii AS, Istanbul, - Borusan Birlesik Boru Fabrikalari AS, Istanbul, - Mannesmann Boru Endustrisi AS, Istanbul, - Erbosan Erciyas Boru Sanayii ve Ticaret AS, Kayseri, - Borutas Boru Sanayii ve Ticaret AS, Adapazari, - Cinar Boru Profil San. Tic. Ltd STI, Eregli, - Sevil Boru-Profil Sanayii ve Ticaret AS, Istanbul, - Toscelik Profil ve Sac. Endüstrisi AS, Iskenderun, - Özborsan Boru San.ve Ticaret AS, Istanbul. 3. Non-cooperating companies (60) The level of cooperation for Turkey was high and the residual provisional dumping margin was set at the same level as for the highest margin level of a cooperating company, i.e. 14,7 %. D. COMMUNITY INDUSTRY 1. Total Community production (61) Within the Community, the product concerned is manufactured by 14 producers located in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, France, Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom, on behalf of which the complaint was lodged, and by 12 other producers. It is considered that all the above 26 producers constitute the Community production within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the basic Regulation. 2. Definition of the Community industry (62) As provided for in the abovementioned notice of initiation, a sample of eight companies(5) amongst the 14 complainant Community producers was selected. These companies fully cooperated in the investigation. The selection of the sample was made by the Commission primarily on the basis of the size of the relevant Community producers in terms of production and sales volume. Additionally, attention was also paid to the criterion of geographic coverage, in order to have a geographically balanced picture of the relevant industry. (63) For information, the eight sampled Community producers alone account for 54 % of the total Community production, for 69 % of the Community industry's production and held, during the IP, a market share of 47 %. (64) It is therefore considered that the 14 complainant Community producers (i.e. both the eight sampled Community producers and the six non-sampled but supporting Community producers) fulfil the requirements of Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation, since they account for a major proportion of the total Community production of the product concerned, in this case around 80 %. The 14 complainant Community producers are therefore deemed to constitute the Community industry within the meaning of Article 4(1) and Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation and will hereinafter be referred to as the ""Community industry"". E. INJURY 1. Community consumption >TABLE> (65) Community consumption was established on the basis of the sales volumes of the Community industry on the Community market, the sales volumes of the other Community producers on the Community market, and Eurostat data for all EU imports, duly adjusted where appropriate. (66) On this basis, between 1998 and the IP, Community consumption of the product concerned increased by 6 %. Specifically, it increased by 8 % between 1998 and 1999 and remained broadly stable at this level until 2001. Between 2001 and the IP, it declined by 3 %. As the product concerned is primarily used in the engineering and construction sector, the development of consumption has to be seen against the background of activity growth in the Community economy at large and more precisely in the construction sector. 2. Decumulation of the imports from Russia from the imports from Turkey (67) The Commission examined whether imports of the product concerned originating in Russia and Turkey should be assessed cumulatively in accordance with Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation. The margin of dumping established in relation to the imports from Russia and Turkey was more than de minimis as defined in Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation. (68) As regards the conditions of competition, the investigation showed that the product concerned imported from Russia and Turkey and those of the Community industry, considered on a type-by-type basis, were alike in all their essential physical and technical characteristics. Furthermore, on that basis, these products were interchangeable and were marketed in the Community during the period considered mostly through comparable sales channels (i.e. traders). Therefore, the imports of the products concerned were considered to compete with each other and with the ones produced in the Community. (69) The Commission assessed whether the volume of imports from each of these countries was not negligible. During the IP, consumption, as defined above, amounted to around 2720000 tonnes. During the same period, Russian exports to the Community of the product concerned amounted, according to Eurostat, to around 26000 tonnes. To this amount should be added around a further 1000 tonnes, as it was found during the verification visit that the cooperating Russian exporter had declared sales of the product concerned to a tariff heading which fell outside the scope of the proceeding. It is therefore provisionally considered that Russia has exported slightly less than 27000 tonnes of the product concerned to the Community, which is just below the de minimis threshold. As a consequence, it is considered that provisional measures should not be imposed on imports originating in Russia. However, the proceeding should remain open and the matter will be investigated further in order to arrive at a definitive determination in this respect. 3. Imports originating in Turkey (the country concerned) Volume (70) The volume of imports of the product concerned from Turkey into the Community increased by 30 % between 1998 and the IP. In detail, imports from Turkey remained relatively stable between 1998 and 1999. Subsequently, they increased sharply by 43 % between 1999 and 2000 from 135357 tonnes to 195331 tonnes. Between 2000 and 2001, they decreased by 8 %, and by a further 2 % between 2001 and the IP. Market share >TABLE> (71) The market share held by the country concerned increased by 1,3 percentage point during the period considered from 5,4 % to 6,7 %. It first declined by 0,5 percentage point between 1998 and 1999, then increased by 2 percentage points to 6,9 % in 2000 before declining slightly to 6,7 % in the IP. (72) It should be noted that over the period 1998 to the IP, the increase in imports and market shares from the country concerned coincided with an increase in consumption of 6 %. Another element to take into consideration is the fact that Turkish producers of the product concerned make substantial profits on their domestic market. In these conditions, the volumes exported depend directly on what the Turkish domestic market can or cannot absorb. For this reason, Turkish export volumes and market share show this relatively uneven behaviour over time. Prices (a) Price evolution (73) Between 1998 and the IP, the average cif prices of imports of the product concerned originating in Turkey first decreased from 331 EUR/tonne in 1998 to 283 EUR/tonne in 1999, but then increased again to 370 EUR/tonne in 2000, declined to 310 EUR/tonne in 2001 and finally ended up a little lower than in 1998 at 314 EUR/tonne during the IP. Average import prices decreased by 14 % between 1998 and 1999 following the decrease in prices of the principal raw material (hot-rolled coils), before rising again by 26 % between 1999 and 2000. In 2001, they declined again, by 18 % and remained practically flat at this level during the IP. (b) Price undercutting (74) A comparison for comparable models of the product concerned was made between the exporting producers' and the Community industry's average selling prices in the Community. To this end, Community industry's ex-works prices to unrelated customers, net of all rebates and taxes have been compared with the cif Community frontier prices of exporting producers of Turkey, duly adjusted for post importation costs, and at the same level of trade. The comparison showed that during the IP the products concerned originating in Turkey were sold in the Community at prices which undercut the Community industry's prices, ranging from 3,8 % to 5,6 %. (75) It should be noted that these price undercutting margins do not fully illustrate the effect of the dumped imports on prices of the Community industry, given that both price depression and price suppression were observed. These are evidenced by the fact that the Community industry made losses between 2000 and the IP, despite the fact that, during this period, it could have made a reasonable profit in the absence of dumping. 4. Situation of the Community industry (76) Pursuant to Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined all relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the Community industry. Preliminary remarks (77) In view of the fact that sampling had been used with regard to the Community industry, the injury has been assessed both on the basis of information collected at the level of the entire Community industry (CI) and on the basis of information collected at the level of the sampled Community producers (SP). (78) Where recourse is made to sampling within the Community industry, it is the Commission's practice to establish certain injury indicators such as production, capacity, stocks, sales, market share and employment for the Community industry as a whole and to establish those injury indicators relating to the performances of individual companies, i.e. prices, costs of production, profits, on the basis of information found for the sampled Community producers. (79) The investigation carried out for the sampled Community producers has shown that their production, capacity, sales, market share and employment data are properly reflected in the information collected at the level of the Community industry. (80) The examination of certain injury indicators (sales volumes, sales prices, profitability ratios) was limited to the sales to unrelated customers. The investigation provisionally found that given that sales to related customers represented on average less than 10 % of the total sales volumes, these sales had no significative impact on the injury trends. Data relating to the Community industry as a whole (a) Production >TABLE> (81) Community industry's production increased slightly (by 7 %) between 1998 and the IP. After an initial increase of around 9 % between 1998 and 1999, it then declined in 2000 by 2 %, increased again in 2001 by 3 % and finally declined by 3 % in the IP. The increase experienced in 1999 was due to the good economic climate, which also translated into a rising capacity utilisation rate. The production increase observed in 2001 aimed at recovering lost market shares, but this took place at the expense of profit margins. (b) Capacity and capacity utilisation rates >TABLE> (82) The reported capacity figures refer to technical capacity, by opposition with theoretical capacity, which implies that adjustments, considered as standards by the industry, for normal holidays, set-up time, maintenance and other normal stoppages have already been discounted. In spite of these adjustments, the complainant himself considers that it is impossible for an individual company to reach a capacity utilisation ratio of a 100 % over a full year. Instead, 80 to 85 % would be considered as an absolute maximum. It should also be noted that the same tube lines are used to manufacture either the product concerned or round tubes. Therefore an apportionment was consistently made for the full tube line capacity reported by each individual company in order to ensure that the capacity described below reflects only the capacity exclusively dedicated to the product concerned. On this basis, the production capacity increased slightly over the period under review. Between 1998 and the IP, the rise amounted to 6 %. It should be noted that a large part of this increase occurred in 1999, i.e. at a time when the Community industry was still profitable. Capacity remained stable in 2000, increased again in 2001 and remained stable at this level in the IP. (83) Capacity utilisation started from a level of 44 % in 1998, before increasing to 46 % in 1999, driven by strong demand and positive profit levels. In 2000, 2001 and the IP, it subsequently declined marginally to 45 % and then back to 44 %. (c) Stocks >TABLE> (84) Community producers generally produce to order and therefore stocks are goods awaiting dispatch to customers. Therefore, the development of inventories does not appear to be relevant for the examination of the economic situation of the Community industry. However, for the sake of completeness, the evolution of stocks is analysed below. Inventories of finished products represent on average 13 % of the EC sales volumes. The level of closing stocks of the Community industry increased progressively throughout the period under review. At the end of the period under consideration, the level of stocks was 13 % higher than in 1998. (d) Sales volume >TABLE> (85) The sales by the Community industry on the Community market to unrelated customers increased by 7 % during the period considered from around 1570000 tonnes in 1998 to around 1680000 tonnes in the IP. It increased by 11 % in 1999, declined by 4 % in 2000, increased again by 4 % in 2001 and declined again by 4 % in the IP. (86) The development of sales volume should be seen in the light of the fact that the Community industry, when faced with increasing low priced imports originating in the country concerned, had the choice of either maintaining its sales prices at the expense of a negative development of its sales volume and market share, or to lower its sales prices and follow the trend of the imports concerned at the expense of its profitability. Between 1998 and 1999, the Community industry benefited from the growing market and increased both its sales volume and profit. However, in 2000, while the market was still growing, the Community industry lost both in terms of sales volumes and profits. In the following years, the Community industry attempted to maintain its sales volumes in a contracting market, but this took place at the expense of profitability. (e) Factors affecting domestic prices (87) The investigation showed that dumped imports were undercutting the average depressed sales price of the Community industry by 5 % on average in the IP. However, on a type-by-type basis it was found that in some instances prices charged by the exporting producers concerned were even significantly lower than the 5 % average, undercutting off the Community industry's prices. The combination of this kind of undercutting with the increased level of dumped imports from Turkey certainly affected the domestic prices of the Community industry. (f) Market share (88) The market share held by the Community industry first increased by almost one percentage point between 1998 and 1999, and then sharply dropped by almost three percentage points in 2000. It increased by some two percentage points in 2001 before declining marginally in the IP. As a result, the market share of the Community industry was, at the end of the period under review very close to the initial level observed in 1998. (g) Growth (89) Between 1998 and the IP, when the Community consumption increased by 6 %, the sales volume of the Community industry increased by 7 %. The Community industry thus maintained broadly its market share, whereas the market share of the imports concerned increased by 1,3 percentage points during the same period. Thus, the Community industry maintained its presence in the market but this should be seen in the light of the development of profitability and return on investments. (h) Employment >TABLE> (90) The level of employment of the Community industry remained stable between 1998 and the IP. It should be noted that these figures show a somewhat too positive picture as several companies were occasionally forced to resort to short time working, when demand was low. (i) Productivity >TABLE> (91) Productivity of the Community industry's workforce, measured as output per person employed per year, first increased strongly by 9 % from 1998 to 1999, before dropping by 4 % between 1999 and 2000, before rising in 2001 and then declining slightly in the IP. At the end of the period under review, the productivity was 6 % higher than that observed at the start of the period. It should be noted that productivity, as it is calculated here (production per employee per year) by definition does not capture either the reduction of working time observed since 1998, notably in France with the implementation of the 35-hour working week, or the fact that certain companies resorted to short-time working (as mentioned above). If the productivity per worker per year rose by a mere 6 % since 1998, this hides that productivity per hour worked progressed much more. (j) Magnitude of dumping margin (92) As concerns the impact on the Community industry of the magnitude of the actual margin of dumping, given the volume and the prices of the imports from the country concerned, this impact cannot be considered to be negligible, especially in transparent and thus highly price sensitive markets like the one of the product concerned. (k) Recovery from the effects of past dumping or subsidisation (93) Considering that this is a new anti-dumping proceeding and that no evidence of previous dumping has been provided, the issue is not considered relevant. Data relating to the sampled Community producers (a) Sales prices (94) Unit sales price first decreased by 9 % in 1999, from EUR/tonne 400 to 365, then increased by 16 % in 2000 to EUR 427, before dropping by 11 % in 2001 to EUR 385, and stabilising at that level in the IP. This relatively uneven development is explained by the following. The prices of the product concerned sold by the Community industry are driven by two major forces: the price of the raw material, normally hot-rolled coils (HRC), which typically represents some 70 % of the total costs of production of the final product, and the competitive situation on the market. (95) Between 1998 and 1999, the costs of production of the Community industry decreased by 10 % due to an important decrease in the prices of HRC. Between 1999 and 2000 the Community industry's costs increased by 20 % as a consequence of an increase in the cost of HRC. Between 2000 and 2001, costs of production decreased by 5 %, and remained broadly flat during the IP. Therefore, during the whole period under review (1998 - IP), total costs of production increased by 3 %, whereas unit sales prices declined by 5 % and as a consequence, the Community industry suffered in terms of decreasing profitability. (b) Wages >TABLE> (96) Between 1998 and the IP, the average wage per employee increased by 5 %. This figure is lower than both the consumer price inflation observed in the Community during the same period (7 %) and than the rate of increase of the average nominal compensation per employee (12 %) observed during the same period in the Community (all sectors). (c) Investments >TABLE> (97) The Community industry's total investments in the product concerned increased by around 60 % between 1998 and the IP. The investigation showed that it is vital for this industry to maintain a certain level of investment in order to stay competitive. Most of the investments were made for modernisation purposes, and very little for capacity augmentation purposes. However, it should be noted that even a replacement investment normally tends to raise slightly the technical capacity, simply because the new equipment is more efficient and productive than the previous one. (d) Profitability and return on investments >TABLE> (98) During the period considered, profitability of sales in the Community to unrelated customers in terms of return on net sales before taxes decreased from 1,4 % in 1998 and 3,3 % in 1999 to - 1,0 % in 2000, - 6,5 % in 2001 and - 6,1 % in the IP. The Community industry was still making profits in the years 1998 and 1999, when dumped imports had a relatively small market share and when demand was growing strongly (+ 8 % between 1998 and 1999). (99) Profitability became negative after 1999, reaching a level insufficient to ensure the long term viability of the Community industry. It should be recalled that prices increased by 5 % between 1999 and the IP while costs increased by 14 %. (100) The return on investments (ROI), expressed as the profit in percent of the net book value of investments, broadly followed the above profitability trend over the whole period considered. It went down from 20 % and 24 % in 1998 and 1999 to - 14 % in 2001 and - 10 % in the IP. (e) Cash flow and ability to raise capital >TABLE> (101) The net cash in (out) flow from operating activities, developed from around EUR 4000 EUR in 1998 to around EUR - 6000 in the IP. It peaked in 1999, but subsequently dropped sharply in 2000 and reached a low in 2001. As a consequence, the Community industry is, on average, increasingly resorting to debt in order to help finance its current activity and investment. (102) The investigation has shown that capital requirements of several sampled Community producers have been adversely affected by their difficult financial situation. Although most of these companies are part of large steel companies, capital requirements are not always met to the desired level, as financial resources are generally allocated within these groups to the most profitable entities. 5. Conclusion on injury (103) Between 1998 and the IP, the volume of the dumped imports of the product concerned originating in Turkey increased significantly by 30 % and its share of the Community market went from 5,4 % in 1998 to 6,7 % in the IP. The largest increase took place between 1999 and 2000, when the volume of dumped imports increased by 43 % gaining two percentage points in market shares. The average prices of dumped imports from Turkey were consistently lower than those of the Community industry during the period considered. Furthermore, during the IP, the prices of the imports from the country concerned undercut those of the Community industry by around 5 % on average. (104) A deterioration of the situation of the Community industry has been found over the period considered. Between 1998 and the IP, several injury indicators developed negatively: the unit sales price declined by 4 % while the unit cost of production increased by 3 %, the profitability went from 1 to 4 % in 1998 and 1999 to - 6 % in 2001 and the IP, the return on investments and the cash-flow from operating activities followed the same negative trend. Some injury indicators remained broadly stable: capacity utilisation, market share of the Community industry, employment. Finally, some indicators experienced apparent positive developments: over the whole period under review, production increased by 7 %, capacity by 6 %, EC sales volumes by 7 %, in line with the development of consumption, investments (consisting mainly of replacement investments) by 61 %. However, it should be noted that the hike in the production volume, in capacity utilisation and in the EC sales volume occurred mostly between 1998 and 1999, at a time when demand was booming. Subsequently, all three data series generally declined. In the light of the foregoing it is provisionally concluded that the Community industry has suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation. F. CAUSATION 1. Introduction (105) In accordance with Article 3(6) and (7) of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined whether the dumped imports of the product concerned originating in the country concerned have caused injury to the Community industry to a degree that enables it to be classified as material. Known factors other than the dumped imports, which could at the same time be injuring the Community industry, were also examined to ensure that possible injury caused by these other factors was not attributed to the dumped imports. 2. Effects of the dumped imports (106) The significant increase in the volume of the dumped imports by 30 %, i.e. from 140000 tonnes in 1998 to 181000 tonnes in the IP, and of its corresponding share of the Community market, i.e. from 5,4 % in 1998 to 6,7 % in the IP as well as the undercutting found (around 5 % on average during the IP) coincided with the deterioration of the economic situation of the Community industry. This market penetration of the dumped imports was particularly significant between 1999 and 2000, when the import volume increased by 43 % and the market share of the dumped imports rose by two percentage points. During the same period, the Community industry suffered a loss of sales volume (- 4 %), market share (- 3 percentage points) and a deterioration of profitability (- 4,3 percentage points). This development should be seen against the background of the slightly growing Community consumption of the product concerned during the years 1999 and 2000. In addition, dumped prices were below those of the Community industry throughout the period considered and exerted a pressure on them which prevented the Community industry's prices from developing at the same rate as the increase in the costs of production between 1999 and the IP, thereby triggering the observed drop into negative financial results from 2000 onwards. It is therefore considered that the dumped imports had a significant negative impact on the situation of the Community industry. 3. Effects of other factors (a) Relatively small market share of the dumped imports (107) The Commission examined whether the fact that dumped imports originating in Turkey held a relatively small and slightly growing market share was such as to break the causal link between the dumped imports from the country concerned and the material injury suffered by the Community industry. As already addressed under recitals 71 and 72, the market share of dumped imports originating in Turkey increased by 1,3 percentage points, from 5,4 % in 1998 to 6,7 % in the IP. A permanent undercutting of Community industry's prices by prices of the product concerned originating in Turkey has been found under recitals 73 and 74. (108) It should first be recalled that the investigation found that Turkish producers of the product concerned made substantial profits on their domestic market. In these conditions, the volumes exported depend directly of what the Turkish domestic market can or cannot absorb. For this reason, Turkish export volumes and market share show a relatively uneven behaviour over time. (109) The market structure of the product concerned is characterised by the relative scattering of the production and by the absence of a genuine dominant position held by one single producer. Indeed, the largest Community producer held during the IP a market share of 10,6 %, whilst seven other Community producers held a market share comprised between 5 % and 10,5 % (110) The product concerned is typically a commodity. It is homogeneous, interchangeable and sold in a transparent market. It should be noted that in terms of volumes, the primary buyers of the product concerned are stockists, who permanently compare prices and, to a large extent, set the final price. (111) All these elements bring the Commission to the conclusion that in this highly price sensitive market, even relatively small quantities can trigger a depressive price effect on the whole Community market. (b) Performance of other Community producers (112) No other Community producer not belonging to the Community industry cooperated in the investigation. Based on best available evidence, the EC sales volume of the other producers has remained relatively stable around 490000 tonnes per year throughout the period under review. As far as their market share is concerned, it declined from 19,2 % in 1998 to 18,1 % in the IP. The above indicates that other producers in the Community did not gain any market shares at the expense of the Community industry, but rather experienced similar market losses as the Community industry. (c) Trade protective measures imposed by the United States of America and other countries, impact of the 11 September 2001 event and export performance of the Community industry (113) One interested party claimed that part of the injury suffered by the Community industry could be attributed to the closure of several important export markets for the Community industry, due to the various safeguard clauses imposed in the United States of America and other countries on the product concerned, and to the impact on global demand of the 11 September 2001 event. (114) Indeed, EC exports of the product concerned are subject to several national safeguard measures implemented from 2001 onward in the wake of the US measures. However, the Community industry increased its export sales volumes by 33 %, namely from around 85000 tonnes in 1998 to around 114000 tonnes in the IP, the major part of this increase taking place between 1998 and 2000. Export sales represented some 7 % of the total sales of the product concerned of the Community industry during the IP. It should also be noted that the aforementioned profitability refers exclusively to EC sales of the product concerned. By contrast, the profitability of export sales was positive throughout 1998 - IP, with ratios ranging between 18 % and 9 %. It is therefore considered that the export activity cannot have contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry. >TABLE> (d) Impact of the economic crisis in South East Asia (115) One interested party argued that any injury suffered by the Community industry was caused by the 1997 and 1998 economic crisis in South East Asia. It should be noted that the Asian crisis may be a cause of the decrease in the price of the steel products and therefore of the main raw material (HRC) used in the production of the product concerned. Therefore, if it could have affected the upstream industry, the producers of the product concerned could benefit from lower prices of the main raw material. In fact when in 1999 the HRC prices were at their lowest level, the Community industry was able to decrease its prices and increase its sales. It should also be noted that the investigation did not show any surge in imports of the product concerned from Asian countries. In view of the above, it is provisionally concluded that the Asian crisis did not contribute to the injury suffered by the Community industry. (e) Imports from other third countries (116) According to the available information, the total import volume of the product concerned originating in third countries increased by 7 % from 197000 tonnes in 1998 to 211000 tonnes in the IP, and their market share first increased from 7,7 % in 1998 to 10 % in 2000, before decreasing to 7,7 % in the IP. As regards the weighted average cif prices of these imports, they decreased by 12 % between 1998 and the IP, from EUR/tonne 444 in 1998 to EUR/tonne 390 in the IP. It should be noted that the prices of imports from other third countries remained substantially higher than the prices of the imports from the country concerned throughout the period considered. (117) It was further found that only imports originating in two countries other than Turkey had a share of the Community market above 1 % during the IP, i.e. Hungary and Slovenia. Regarding Hungary, it was found that its market share decreased from 1,9 % in 1998 to 1,7 % in the IP. Concerning Slovenia, its market share, which was nil in 1998, decreased from 1,5 % in 1999 to 1,2 % in the IP. Although they appear to undercut the Community industry's prices, cif import prices of these two countries have always been above those of the country concerned. Furthermore, no evidence is available that would indicate that these imports may have been made at dumped prices. In conclusion, any effect of these imports on the Community industry's situation was only marginal, given the average prices, the small volume of these imports and their limited market share. It is therefore provisionally concluded that the imports from third countries only contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry to a very limited extent, if at all, and that their effect was consequently not such as to alter the finding that there is a genuine and substantial relationship of cause and effect between the dumped imports from the country concerned and the material injury suffered by the Community industry. (f) Over-investment and over-capacity (118) Several interested parties claimed that the Community industry, like the global steel industry, suffers from chronic over-capacity, due, inter alia, to the slow world market growth for steel products, the fact that steel is increasingly replaced by other materials in some applications, and the improvement in steel's own mechanical properties such as strength and stiffness. It is therefore argued that any injury felt by the Community industry is merely the result of a systematic over-spending in investment goods, conducive to the accumulation of excess capacities. (119) Investment carried out by the Community industry has consisted mainly in the replacement and modernisation of obsolete tube lines, and in the construction of new, fully-automated warehouses. Little of this investment has served for capacity augmentation purposes. It should be noted that even a replacement investment normally tends to raise slightly the technical capacity, simply because the new equipment is more efficient and productive than the previous one. The augmentation of capacity, which is rather limited (6 % over four years) has also to be seen against the following background: the Community industry was profitable at the start of the period under review and demand was booming. A contrario, the already high capacity figures observed in the years 1998 and 1999, at a time when volumes of dumped imports were low, did not prevent the Community industry from making profits in these years. Finally, it should be noted that one sampled Community producer closed one plant in 1998, representing a capacity of 50000 tonnes. It is therefore provisionally concluded that the alleged over-investment and over-capacity only contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry to a very limited extent, if at all, and that their effect was consequently not such as to alter the finding that there is a genuine and substantial relationship of cause and effect between the dumped imports from the country concerned and the material injury suffered by the Community industry. (g) Decline in demand illustrated by the drop in the activity of the construction sector (120) One interested party claimed that any injury felt by the Community industry was linked to the downturn experienced by the primary consumer of the product concerned, namely the construction sector. To support its allegation, the said party presented a Eurostat data series referring to the EU production in the construction sector, which shows a flattening of growth in this specific sector in 2000 and 2001, followed by a decline from the last quarter of 2001 onwards. (121) The 2002 recession in the construction sector is acknowledged and is indeed confirmed by the consumption figures of the product concerned presented above. These latter show that consumption of the product concerned peaked in 2000, and subsequently declined in both 2001 and the IP. However, it should be borne in mind that the major shift from a profitable situation of 3,3 % to a loss situation of around 1 % occurred between 1999 and 2000, in spite of the market peaking that year. The same year, import volumes from Turkey had sharply increased by 43 % and their market share from 4,9 % to 6,9 %. It is therefore provisionally concluded that the decline in demand illustrated by the drop in the activity of the construction sector only contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry to a very limited extent, if at all, and that the effect was consequently not such as to alter the finding that there is a genuine and substantial relationship of cause and effect between the dumped imports from the country concerned and the material injury suffered by the Community industry. 4. Conclusion on causation (122) In conclusion, it is confirmed that the material injury of the Community industry, which is characterised especially by the decline in unit sales price (4 %) while the unit cost of production increased by 3 %, the drop in profitability from 1998 and 1999 to 2001 and the IP, the similar drop in the return on investments and the cash flow from operating activities was caused by the dumped imports concerned. (123) Indeed, the effects of the relatively small market share of the dumped imports, of the performance of other Community producers, of trade protective measures imposed by the US and other countries, of the impact of the 11 September 2001 event and of the export performance of the Community industry, of the economic crisis in South East Asia, of the imports from other third countries, of alleged over-investment and over-capacity, of the decline in demand illustrated by the drop in the activity of the construction sector on the Community industry's negative developments was non-existent or only very limited and consequently not such as to alter the finding that there is a genuine and substantial relationship of cause and effect between the dumped imports from the country concerned and the material injury suffered by the Community industry. (124) It is therefore provisionally concluded that the dumped imports originating in Turkey have caused material injury to the Community industry within the meaning of Article 3(6) of the basic Regulation. G. COMMUNITY INTEREST (125) The Commission examined whether, despite the conclusions on dumping, injury and causation, compelling reasons existed which would lead to the conclusion that it is not in the Community interest to adopt measures in this particular case. For this purpose, and pursuant to Article 21(1) of the basic Regulation, the Commission considered the likely impact of measures for all parties concerned in the investigation. 1. Interest of the Community industry Nature and structure of the Community industry (126) The Community industry is composed of 14 companies. Almost all of them are part of international groups acting mainly in the steel sector. Many of them purchase the main raw material from other companies of their group at market prices. The Community industry employed a total of around 160000 people out of which 2772 were employed directly for the product concerned in the IP. Possible effects of the imposition/non-imposition of measures on the Community industry (127) Following an imposition of measures, it is expected that the volume of sales of the product concerned by the Community industry on the Community market would rise. This would enable the Community industry to gain market shares and, by increasing capacity utilisation, decrease unit production costs and further increase productivity. Furthermore, the level of the Community industry's prices could increase moderately, although certainly not by the level of any anti-dumping duty since competition will still remain amongst Community producers, imports originating in the country concerned made at non-dumped prices and imports originating in other third countries. In conclusion it is expected that the increase in production and sales volume, on the one hand, and the further decrease in unit costs, on the other hand, perhaps combined with a moderate price increase, will allow the Community industry to improve its financial situation. (128) On the other hand, should anti-dumping measures not be imposed, it is likely that the negative trend of the Community industry will continue. The Community industry suffers particularly from its loss-making situation. Indeed, in view of the material injury already suffered during the IP and also given the downturn evident in the construction industry since the start of 2002, it is obvious that the financial situation of the Community industry will deteriorate further in the absence of any measures. This will in all likelihood lead to cuts in production, closures of certain production lines and therefore threaten employment and investments in the Community. Conclusion (129) In conclusion, the imposition of anti-dumping measures would allow the Community industry to recover from the effects of injurious dumping found. 2. Interest of unrelated importers/traders in the Community (130) The distribution of the product concerned in the Community is characterised by the presence of importers/traders who trade in a large number of other products as well. Both Community industry and exporting producers sell their products in the Community through traders. Given the large number of importers involved, the Commission decided to apply sampling pursuant to Article 17 of the basic Regulation and announced this in the notice of initiation accordingly. The Commission requested all 102 importers listed in the complaint to reply to the questions listed in the Notice of Initiation, i.e. basically their total turnover, their total number of employees, their volume and value of imports into and resales made in the Community market during the IP of the product concerned. (131) Twelve importers agreed to be included in the sample and provided the requested basic information within the deadline. In view of this situation, it was decided to send the questionnaire intended for importers to all the 12 abovementioned companies. Only six(6) out of these 12 importers finally fully cooperated and filled out the questionnaire. (132) The six cooperating importers represent about 45 % of the total import volume of the product concerned from the country concerned in the Community during the IP. Should anti-dumping measures be imposed, it is possible that the level of imports originating in the country concerned may decrease. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that the imposition of anti-dumping measures may result in a moderate increase in the prices of the product concerned in the Community, thus affecting the economic situation of importers and traders. However, the impact of any anti-dumping duty on the situation of importers and traders should be seen in the light of the small part of their overall activities represented by trade in the product concerned. On the basis of the information provided by the above cooperating importers, it has been found that the product concerned imported from Turkey represented on average about 12 % of the cooperating companies' total turnover. Likewise, the investigation showed that the proportion of employees directly or indirectly involved in the trading of the product concerned represented only 23 % of a total staff of 107 employees of the above cooperating importers. Thus, the effect of any measures on the importers' overall business would be limited. Furthermore, the effect on importers of the increase in the prices of imports of the product concerned will depend on their ability to pass on increases in prices to their customers. The low proportion of the product concerned in users' total costs should make it easier for the importers to pass any price increase on to users. On this basis, it has been provisionally concluded that the imposition of anti-dumping measures is not likely to have a serious negative effect on the situation of importers in the Community. 3. Interest of the user industry (133) The main user of the product concerned in the Community is the construction industry. Consequently, the demand for the product concerned is primarily dependent upon the evolution of construction works in the private and industrial sectors. Questionnaires were sent to 11 associations of users which were invited to forward copies of the questionnaire intended for users to those of their members which were concerned by the investigation. No questionnaire replies were received by the Commission either from interested users or their representative associations. Given the absence of interest of the users of the product concerned, it can be provisionally concluded that the imposition of any antidumping measure is unlikely to affect seriously their situation. 4. Conclusion on Community interest (134) The effects of the imposition of measures can be expected to afford the Community industry with the opportunity to regain lost sales and market shares and to improve its profitability. On the other hand, in view of the deteriorated situation of the Community industry, there is a risk that in the absence of measures, certain Community producers may close down their production lines or even whole production facilities and lay-off part of their workforce. Whilst some negative effects are likely to result in the form of decrease in the volumes imported and moderate price increases for the importers/traders, the extent of these may be reduced by passing the increase on to the users. Users, in turn, are unlikely to suffer serious consequences from such an increase given the likely low incidence of the product concerned on their final products. In the light of the above, it is provisionally concluded that no compelling reasons exist for not imposing measures in the present case and that the application of measures would be in the interest of the Community. H. PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES (135) In view of the conclusions reached with regard to dumping, injury, causation and Community interest, provisional measures should be taken in order to prevent further injury to the Community industry by the dumped imports. 1. Injury elimination level (136) The level of the provisional anti-dumping measures should be sufficient to eliminate the injury to the Community industry caused by the dumped imports, without exceeding the dumping margins found. When calculating the amount of duty necessary to remove the effects of the injurious dumping, it was considered that any measures should allow the Community industry to cover its costs and obtain a profit before tax that could be reasonably achieved under normal conditions of competition, i.e. in the absence of dumped imports. (137) On the basis of the information available, it was preliminarily found that a profit margin of 3,3 % of turnover, which the Community industry achieved in 1999, could be regarded as an appropriate level which the Community industry could be expected to obtain in the absence of injurious dumping. The necessary price increase was then determined on the basis of a comparison, at the same level of trade, of the weighted average import price, as established for the price undercutting calculations, with the non-injurious price of products sold by the Community industry on the Community market. The non-injurious price has been obtained by adjusting the sales price of each company composing the Community industry to a break-even point and by adding the abovementioned profit margin. Any difference resulting from this comparison was then expressed as a percentage of the total cif import value. (138) The individual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this document were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigation. Therefore, they reflect the situation found during that investigation with respect to these companies. These duty rates (as opposed to the countrywide duty applicable to ""all other companies"") are thus exclusively applicable to imports of products originating in the country concerned and produced by the companies and thus by the specific legal entities mentioned. Imported products produced by any other company not specifically mentioned in the operative part of this Regulation with its name and address, including entities related to those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from these rates and shall be subject to the duty rate applicable to ""all other companies"". (139) Any claim requesting the application of these individual company anti-dumping duty rates (e.g. following a change in the name of the entity or following the setting up of new production or sales entities) should be addressed to the Commission forthwith with all relevant information, in particular any modification in the company's activities linked to production, domestic and export sales associated with, for example, that name change or that change in the production and sales entities. The Commission, if appropriate, will, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, amend the Regulation accordingly by updating the list of companies benefiting from individual duty rates. 2. Proposed provisional measures (140) In the light of the foregoing, it is considered that, in accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, a provisional anti-dumping duty should be imposed in respect of imports originating in Turkey at the level of the dumping margins found, as these were found to be lower than the injury margins. 3. Undertakings (141) Pursuant to Article 46 of Decision No 1/95 of the EU-Turkey Association Council on implementing the final phase of the customs union, cooperating exporting producers in the Turkey received early information on the findings of the investigation. A number of exporting producers, namely Özdemir Boru Profil San.ve Ticaret AS, MMZ Onur Boru Profil Uretim and Guven Boru ve Profil Sanayi ve Ticaret Ltd, offered price undertakings in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation. (142) In this respect, the Commission has noted that: - the product concerned is a commodity product with a considerable volatility in prices even in the very short term, and therefore not suitable for a fixed price undertaking: the volatility is partially due to the variation in prices of raw materials, namely hot-rolled coils, which constitute major but variable components of the cost of production. Moreover, volatility is also linked to currency exchanges rates, which are stable within the Community except for the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark, but fast changing with regard to the United States Dollar, the currency in which the transactions are made in Turkey. A monthly revision of prices would be necessary, - if the MIPs (minimum import prices) were indexed to the price of hot-rolled coils, different indexing formulae would have to be established by subproduct group, since the energy and manpower per tonne vary between sizes. For this reason, should a review formula system be implemented, it would be necessary to establish between three and four subformulae for each category of product according to the size range, - the product has a very large number of presentations (up to 250) given that several factors (steel grade, sizes, thickness,..) affect prices. This renders customs control unduly burdensome and complicated. (143) Moreover, some of the producers who offered price undertakings export a variety of steel products such as welded tubes, structural pipes, carbon steel tubes, square tubing, rectangular tubing, etc., which are only partially subject to the anti-dumping investigation. The risk of compensation in prices for the different products exported to the same customers is therefore high. On a general basis, the Community industry also claimed that undertakings, and thus minimum prices, would clearly not be appropriate measures with regard to the product concerned for the same reasons. (144) In light of the above, these offers of price undertakings were rejected. I. FINAL PROVISION (145) In the interest of sound administration, a period should be fixed within which the interested parties which made themselves known within the time limit specified in the notice of initiation may make their views known in writing and request a hearing. Furthermore, it should be stated that the findings concerning the imposition of duties made for the purposes of this Regulation are provisional and may have to be reconsidered for the purpose of any definitive duty, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 1. A provisional anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of hollow sections which consist of welded pipes, tubes and hollow profiles of a square or rectangular cross-section of iron or steel with the exception of those made of stainless steel or of a perimeter greater than 600 mm, currently classifiable within CN codes ex 7306 60 31 (TARIC code 7306 60 31 90 ) and ex 7306 60 39 (TARIC code 7306 60 39 90 ), and originating in Turkey, and originating in Turkey. 2. The rate of the provisional duty applicable to the net free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, for products produced by the following manufacturers shall be as follows: >TABLE> 3. Unless otherwise specified, the provisions in force concerning customs duties shall apply. 4. The release for free circulation in the Community of the product referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to the provision of a security, equivalent to the amount of the provisional duty. Article 2 1. Without prejudice to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, interested parties requesting disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which this Regulation was adopted, shall present their views in writing and request a hearing from the Commission within one month of the date of entry into force of this regulation. 2. Pursuant to Article 21(4) of Regulation No 384/96, the parties concerned may comment on the application of this Regulation within one month of the date of its entry into force. Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. Article 1 of this Regulation shall apply for a period of six months. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

"ORME, Tennessee (CNN) -- The drought in the Southeastern United States means more than just brown lawns to the folks in Orme, Tennessee. Water flows from their taps for just three hours each evening. A 1961 firetruck loads up with water from a hydrant in Alabama to haul back to Orme, Tennessee. The mountain spring that supplies water to the town usually dries up at the end of summer, but just for a few days. This year it dried up early, on August 1, and hasn't revived, leaving the town's 145 residents high and dry and relying on water trucked in from the next state. Every day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town's tank. When he turns the crank again at 9 p.m., taps in the town run dry. ""When they cut it back on we jump for joy,"" Orme resident Debbie Cash said. ""And then you only have it for three hours."" Three hours to do all the laundry, bathing, dishwashing and animal watering that has to be done. Watch how Cash copes » . The old mining town could be the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the region. Just 150 miles to the southeast, the 4.5 million people who live in and around Atlanta, Georgia, are nervously watching water levels go down at their major reservoir. The drought has highlighted an ongoing struggle between Georgia, Alabama and Florida over rights to water from the Chattahoochee River. ""All of these people that are on the river systems better take note, because once your streams and tributaries to the river start drying up, the river isn't far behind,"" Reames said. See photos of a Atlanta's shrinking Lake Lanier reservoir » . Volunteers take turns three days a week driving a tanker truck or Orme's diesel-belching 1961 fire truck to a hydrant near Bridgeport, Alabama, 2½ miles down the road. Making several round trips, they haul about 25,000 gallons of water back to Orme each day. Bridgeport, which gets its water from the Tennessee River, doesn't charge its neighbor. Stevenson and New Hope, Alabama, also help out, occasionally bringing trucks full of water to the hydrant, where it's transferred to the Orme trucks. See where Orme has to go for water » . But things are looking up in Orme. A pipeline from Bridgeport is nearly complete, built with the help of a $378,000 grant from the federal government. ""With this new water coming in, then we'll have it made,"" Cash said. ""Now we won't have to worry about it no more."" In addition, an Austin, Texas, company called H2O Guard is planning to donate water-saving sink aerators, shower heads and toilet valves to everyone in Orme on November 17, company spokesman Robert Easter said. ""We think we're going to get another 90 gallons' savings per day per household,"" Easter said. ""That'll make that little water tower in that town go from three hours to four hours without any change in anyone's habits."" Reames said residents have found creative ways to conserve, flushing toilets with condensation water from air conditioners and undrinkable water from swimming pools that were filled early in the summer. It's a lesson for everyone. ""Cherish the water you got and be kind of careful with it,"" Cash said, ""because you never know if you will be out of water."" E-mail to a friend .

"CARDIFF, Wales -- Former Wales and British Lions center Ray Gravell has died of a suspected heart attack aged 56, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has announced. Gravell won 23 caps for Wales and played on the Lions tour of South Africa in 1980. Gravell had been on holiday with his family in the Spanish Mediterranean island of Mallorca at the time. A WRU statement praised Gravell as being ""a man who epitomized the passion, flair and dignity of his beloved Welsh nation."" Gravell made his debut for Wales against France in 1975, three years after helping his club side Llanelli to their famous win over the touring All Blacks. In all he made 23 appearances for what was then a dominant Wales side, winning Grand Slams in 1976 and 1978, and played all four Tests on the Lions' tour of South Africa in 1980. After retiring as a player in 1985, Gravell became president of Llanelli RFC and the Llanelli Scarlets. He also pursued a career as an actor and a respected rugby broadcaster. Earlier this year, Gravell had his right leg amputated below the knee following complications linked with his diabetes but he had been recovering well. WRU chief executive Roger Lewis said: ""We are all in total shock because Ray was so full of life even through the difficult health problems he suffered recently. ""He was a wonderful ambassador for rugby and for Wales and a great example of how the game can bring out the best in a man. ""As a player, he always gave a huge amount of respect to his opponents but never gave an inch of ground to anyone he faced on the field of play.

"Glasgow City Council said it planned to put up the tax by 3% after the national council tax freeze ended this year. Council leader Frank McAveety said while the increase would raise more than £7m, the council faced a budget gap of £67m. Most councils have yet to confirm plans, with about a third indicating they may propose a 3% increase. Further details of Glasgow's budget proposals are expected later. Mr McAveety said: ""Raising Council Tax will support frontline services while protecting the most vulnerable in our city. ""One-in-four households will not pay a penny more - and we can avoid around £7m of the most difficult cuts, which would otherwise hit every community across the city."" The average bill in the city - in the Band D category - is £1,213, compared to the national average of £1,149. All other bills are a set proportion of this figure. But changes this year mean those in bands E, F, G and H properties will automatically pay more - even before the 3% across-the-board rise is factored in. Increases are due to take effect just weeks before May's council elections. BBC Scotland's local government correspondent Jamie McIvor said: ""Inevitably, close attention will be paid to decisions taken by councils in the west of Scotland where the SNP is hoping to make big inroads into Labour's council powerbase. ""Privately, some Labour councillors believe they are caught between a rock and a hard place. ""They argue a rise in council tax would merely limit cuts rather than end them, so they would risk asking voters to 'pay more and get less'. ""However, they also believe that if they did not raise the council tax, they would be accused of failing to use the means at their disposal to at least attempt to mitigate cuts."" Labour-run South Lanarkshire has said it plans to freeze bills this year but the leader of West Dunbartonshire Council has indicated a rise is likely. There have been no public declarations yet from Labour-run Inverclyde, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire. The Scottish government has said more money would be available in the coming financial year for local services across Scotland. For example, there will be new money through the council tax changes and cash which will be given to headteachers to spend on schemes to raise attainment.

"The biggest Commons clash is likely to be over Sunday trading - where a well organised group of Tory rebels looks set to line up with Labour, to try to strike down proposals to loosen restrictions. The SNP look likely to be the swing vote in this particular debate. Elsewhere, there's a new and multi-faceted crime bill, and in the Lords there's some preliminary sparring over the Trade Union Bill. There may also be votes on the Immigration Bill. But it looks as if the Commons-Lords ""ping-pong"" on the proposals to reform Employment Support Allowance for some disabled people may be petering out. Here's my rundown of the week ahead: The Commons opens at 2.30pm for Education questions. As usual any post weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30pm. Then it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will: In the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the ""Work Related Activities Group"", and content themselves with a ""regret"" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another ""regret motion"" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support. And that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords. The Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools. He says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance. After that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme. And there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers. There will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM. In Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am). Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe. And at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a Â£1bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a Â£20bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure. In the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale. Then peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned. The sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely. There will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry. The Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's ""engine room,"" followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister. Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material. She has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Llywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking. Then MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading. Labour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops. The day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm). In the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan. The really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession. There will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee). The Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour. This will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the ""check-off"" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more. The various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences. The Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July. Then MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief. The decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays. In the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on ""pay to stay"" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above). There will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House. The Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law. But the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate. His close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus. For the record, the current batting order is: Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh). There are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so. It's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill. More bills may be added to this list.",formal
"Lisa Doughty, who has mesothelioma, was a pupil at Haggerston Girls' School in Hackney, east London in the 1980s. The 47-year-old said the music desks were often covered in dust, which may have had asbestos particles. Hackney Council said it had not received a formal claim and could not investigate until it did. Ms Doughty said she had spent a lot of time in the music room each week rehearsing plays. ""We used to sit on the desks and have to wipe white dust off them,"" she said. ""There were two heavy doors at the entrance to the music room and these would constantly slam, shaking the room. The school was in pretty bad repair so maybe the dust came down from the ceiling when the door closed.""

"There was a interview done over the summer with a Japanese game designer whose name escapes me. The main focus was your question. His thoughts on it was that Japanese game developers had gotten complacent and no longer create games that are as interesting as they had in the past. That the cool visuals are there but a good narrative is missing. Also Japan had always made game for it's markets first and then released them to the rest of the world. Now there are more game developers making games geared towards US and Euro sales. Go and look at the games released in the 80's and 90's, and compare them to the release lists from 00's. I would think that the 00's list might be bigger and has a more diverse list of developers Over the last decade there has been a major shift in what type of games are available. The 80's had a few types that the 90's expanded on that list and the 00's saw those game types multiply by stitching together different types into new ""frankenstein"" game types. Like Borderlands being a Shooter with RPG elements, or Fallout New Vegas being a RPG with shooter elements. TLDR: Japan got lazy, and there is way more competition",informal

"edit: this is long, I tried to explain in a point by point format at the bottom exactly what I'm trying to say. >It seems to me to be a disagreement whereby you are saying the situation where men pay more is OK and others are saying it is not. No, I'm specifically trying (and apparently failing) to say this is NOT okay, but unfortunately it is currently how it is (or at least this has been the expectation I've seen from pretty much everyone, male or female). What I'm then saying is that because it is how it is (at least how I've seen it be), being up front about one's expectations prevents the (unfortunate) reality of how it is. __I fully admit I'm saying this very badly.__ >Why did you see the need to create a new thread to talk about this? What was wrong with the old thread where you had a very large number of comments, and which was on the front page? My problem was it was pretty much just you and I going back and forth, and I wanted to get help trying to understand where the disconnect was. After looking back at my initial point (after what someone else said) I realized I had worded things very badly. >Is this some sort of attempt to gain protection from the men on this board? It comes across as a bit ""help! some men are bullying me!"" appeal. Sorry, that wasn't my intention. My intention was specifically to get help clarifying either where I was going wrong in communicating what I was trying to communicate, or where I was going wrong in trying to understand what you were trying to say. Barring that, if I was actually reading you correctly, I wanted confirmation of that, rather than leaving it as me being unsure. Also, you have repeatedly treated me as if I'm the one asking to be paid for, or as if I am a woman. I should probably let you know that I'm a man. >I don't know what that means but I don't really have any idea who people are as far as interacting with them before as I have a bad memory for that sort of thing. Reddit Enhancement Suite is a javascript plugin type thing you can get. While using it, it will track your upvotes and downvotes on specific people. Overall, I've upvoted you 66 times (in aggregate, after subtracting downvotes), so it's clear that normally I agree with your stated opinions. If I hadn't had so many upvotes on your username, I probably would have just written you off rather than trying to understand where the issue was. >OTOH I don't think the result is a bad approach as I react to what people say, not who they are. You're probably right that this is a much better method. I try to react to what is being said as well, but I'll admit that seeing my past voting record on a person probably does bias me towards them (either positively or negatively). Let me see if I can TLDR what I'm trying to say: 1. Currently, my experience is that most people (of either gender) expect the asker to pay. 2. In my opinion, going dutch _absolutely should_ be the default. 3. Because number 2 is not (by most people, seemingly) the case, making things clear up front avoids problems. 4. I put the responsibility on the asker, which I'll admit may be unfair, but it's because the asker is the one more likely to want to change the ""default"" mode. * My IDEAL situation, and what I think we should work towards (though I'm not sure how), is the majority of people expecting to go dutch.",informal

"(CNN) -- A Marine convicted for his role in the death of an Iraqi civilian was sentenced Friday to a reduction in rank and will be discharged. Cpl. Trent D. Thomas was found guilty Wednesday of kidnapping and conspiracy to commit several offenses -- including murder, larceny, housebreaking, kidnapping, and making false official statements -- for his involvement in the April 2006 death in Hamdaniya, Iraq. Thomas will be demoted to the rank of entry-level private and will receive a bad-conduct discharge. The 25-year-old was among seven Marines and a Navy medic who were charged in connection with the death of Hashim Ibrahim Awad, 52. The Marines accused in the case were members of Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment. They reported at the time that Awad planned to detonate a roadside bomb targeting their patrol. But several residents of Hamdaniya, including relatives of the victim, gave a different account, prompting a criminal investigation. Prosecutors accuse the group's squad leader, Sgt. Lawrence G. Hutchins III, of dragging Awad from his home, shooting him in the street and then making it look like he had planned to ambush American troops. Hutchins has pleaded not guilty to murder, conspiracy and other charges in the case. He faces a sentence of life in prison if convicted. Thomas changed his plea from guilty to not guilty in February, arguing that he had merely followed orders. He told his attorneys that after reviewing the evidence against him, he realized ""that what happened overseas happened as a result of obedience to orders, and he hasn't done anything wrong,"" defense attorney Victor Kelley said. Thomas said in January, shortly after entering his guilty plea, that he was ""truly sorry"" for his role in the killing. He could have been sentenced to life in prison under his original plea.

"One person was injured in the crash on Saturday night, which happened during heavy rain near the national stadium. Police said in a statement on Monday that both drivers were in their 20s and unemployed. The statement prompted many questions online about how they came to be driving the cars. ""What are their names? Who are their fathers?"" one user on the Weibo microblog site asked, according to AFP. ""Socialism is so good that it allows unemployed people to drive supercars,"" joked another. Photos which emerged on Monday showed the lime green Lamborghini with its front section almost entirely torn off. The red Ferrari appeared to have lost a door, and was bashed along on its side and rear. The tunnel itself was also damaged, with a section of the wall torn off and guardrails mangled. Workers could be seen clearing up debris strewn across the road. The cause of the crash is not clear, but police are investigating. Witnesses told local media that the tunnel was often used for drag racing. It was widely observed online that the crash coincided with both the Grand Prix being hosted in Shanghai and the premiere of the latest Fast and Furious film, a franchise full of fast cars and high-value write-offs.",formal

"(CNN) -- If you thought it was difficult managing your own money in 2007, consider the pressure of the task when you're dealing with $1.8 trillion of client assets. Sallie Krawcheck has made Fortune's list of the World's Most Powerful Women every year since 2002 . That's what Sallie Krawcheck does as Chairman and Chief Executive of Citi Global Wealth Management. She joined the banking industry as a research analyst, but quickly rose through the ranks, gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity along the way. Dubbed the ""Mrs Clean"" of Wall Street, Ms Krawcheck was credited with restoring investors' faith in analyst reports while head of retail brokerage firm Smith Barney. She joined Citigroup in 2002, and spent some time as Chief Financial Officer before taking up her current role in March 2007. Sallie Krawcheck has been a regular entrant on Fortune's list of the World's Most Powerful Women in Business -- in 2007, she made number 12. John Defterios caught up with Ms Krawcheck in Dubai. He asked her for her views on the movement of capital outside the G8 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States). Sallie Krawcheck (SK): I think what's happening right now, it's fascinating because in the United States and in developed Europe we're having a liquidity crunch -- someone might argue a liquidity crisis. And in fact, we are awash with liquidity in the Middle East and in Asia as well, so there's really a bifurcation that's occurring in the world. And if you think about, oil doesn't even have to stay at the 90-plus dollar level it is; even at levels in the 70's, 60's, 50's, 40's, a tremendous amount of liquidity is being generated in these markets which is really being put back into the market. Yes, the investments are going up globally, but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region. And so over time, you're really going to see... I think continue to see... a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the Middle East as well as to Asia. John Defterios (JD): It's coming almost as a perfect storm; we have a sub prime crisis, a 20 percent fall in the dollar in the last two years. In this window of time, is there a danger that the financial capitals build outside of Wall Street and it undermines its role? (SK): I think there is no doubt that New York is losing its status as a financial capital of the world. If you think about some years ago, if you think about the internet bubble for example, where it was New York and California wasn't it? And you look at a whole range of reasons for it, and the sub prime crisis perhaps, the decline of the dollar perhaps. But you have overlapping regulators in the United States, you have very high taxes in the United States, you have a very litigious environment in the United States, and you have the emerging markets coming up, so capital is being raised outside of the United States. These things, some of which are negative for the United States, some of which are positive for the other regions, is accelerating a shift that was underway from New York, to London, to Hong Kong, to Singapore, and potentially to Dubai as well. (JD): Some of the wealth funds are now on the radar of both Wall Street and Capitol Hill in Washington. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't say I want some of that liquidity but I only want part of that liquidity. What is the result of that do you think? Can you over-regulate the sovereign funds? (SK): Oh, I think you can over-regulate the sovereign funds. I think the same question can be asked of the private equity funds and the hedge funds as well; where in a lot of countries the regulators have been struggling with the issue of 'here are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity'. And the concern is if, gee these are going to be important going forward, we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets, but if we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market -- to a market outside the United States or Europe for example. (JD): It's fascinating because if you look at Qatar or Egypt or Shanghai, the stock markets have almost had like a one way path; there's been some correction here in the Middle East. But what are we likely to see here, stair steps up the ladder with some corrections along the way, or an implosion because of the rapid gains? (SK): I think you've got to separate the idea of what's going on in the real economies and what's going on in the market places. They move together, but sometimes they separate, they diverge, and they can diverge for a long period of time. If you look at economic growth potential of the Middle East, of Asia, of Latin America, we feel very bullish about this. And I was making the point earlier today, China has been growing at 11 or 12 percent, not for one year or two years, but literally for 30 years. For 30 years it's been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see. So, say the same thing for the Middle East, the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant, but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward. (JD): Is Wall Street, or for that matter, London or any other financial center ready for a woman -- for example in your case, 1.4 trillion dollars of assets... (SK): 1.8 Thank you... (JD): ...to run one of the major money center banks of the world? I'm sure you're feeling this pressure even though you're young by international standards. Are we ready for a woman to take over a money center bank? (SK): Well it looks like the United States may be ready for a woman to take over as President. So I think if we're ready to potentially have a woman run the country, I think we are getting ready as a country, to potentially have a woman run a money center bank. Now, you know, the board wouldn't ask and I wouldn't accept, but if you look across Wall Street, there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are CEO's who move along, and I think it's a very exciting development for the industry and for the country.

"In the court filings, the organisations said that there was ""no adequate justification"" for the FBI to continue to withhold the information. They added that they did not seek information that would jeopardise national security. The groups sued the FBI last year. Associated Press, Vice Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA Today, are seeking to learn more about the circumstances surrounding the event. The FBI has never named the security firm or group of hackers who helped unlock the phone, which was used by killer Syed Rizwan Farook. The process would have involved finding a way to bypass the passcode on a locked phone. In normal circumstances, if 10 incorrect attempts at the code are made, the device will automatically erase all of its data. ""While it is undisputed that the vendor developed the iPhone access tool, the government has identified no rational reason why knowing the vendor's identity is linked in any way to the substance of the tool, much less how such knowledge would reveal any information about the tool's application,"" lawyers for the news organisations wrote in the filing to the US District Court in Washington. ""Release of this information goes to the very heart of the Freedom of Information Act's purpose, allowing the public to assess government activity - here, the decision to pay public funds to an outside entity in possession of a tool that can compromise the digital security of millions of Americans."" Farook and his wife killed 14 people in the Californian city in December 2015. In February, a court order demanded that Apple help unlock the phone, something which Apple resisted, saying it was unable to do so. It added that it hoped that the government would share with the company any vulnerabilities of the iPhone that might come to light. There was speculation that the FBI paid at least $1.3m (Â£1.05m) to break into the phone, based on calculations following comments by FBI director James Comey who said that the agency had paid more to get into the phone than he ""will make in the remaining seven years"" in his post.

(2) The harmonisation of radio services contributes to a safer navigation of non-SOLAS vessels, particularly in case of distress and safety situations and such vessels are therefore invited by Member States to participate in the AIS. (3) The AIS is described in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Regulation 19 to Chapter V of SOLAS - Carriage requirements for shipborne navigational systems and equipment. (4) The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations has designated certain frequencies 161.975 (AIS1) and 162.025 (AIS2) MHz for use by the AIS. Other frequencies allocated for maritime communications may be available to the AIS. All radio equipment operating on those frequencies should be compatible with the designated use of these frequencies and it should provide a reasonable guarantee of assurance that it will function correctly in times of operation. (5) The scope of Commission Decision 2003/213/EC of 25 March 2003 on application of Article 3(3)(e) of Directive 1999/5/EC to marine communication equipment intended to be used on non-SOLAS vessels and which is intended to participate in the Automatic Identification System (AIS) (2) is limited to equipment which is intended to be used on non-SOLAS vessels. It is considered that a high level of safety can only be achieved if all equipment used on non-SOLAS vessels and corresponding land-stations participating in the AIS system functions correctly. Therefore the same requirements should apply to all AIS stations. (6) In the interests of legal clarity and transparency Decision 2003/213/EC should therefore be replaced. (7) This decision should only apply after a period of time sufficient to allow manufacturers to align their production of equipment in accordance with the new essential requirement. (8) The measures set out in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Telecommunications Conformity Assessment and Market Surveillance Committee, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Radio equipment which operates in the maritime mobile service as defined in Article 1.28 of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Radio Regulations, or in the maritime mobile satellite service as defined in Article 1.29 of the ITU Radio Regulations shall comply with the essential requirements set out in Article 3(3)(e) of Directive 1999/5/EC. To that end such equipment shall be designed in such a way as to ensure that it operates correctly in its intended environment when used on non-SOLAS vessels and land-stations and it shall meet all the appropriate operational requirements of the Automatic Identification System (AIS).

"MADRID, Spain -- Lionel Messi scored for the sixth game in a row as Barcelona defeated big-spending Atletico Madrid 3-0 to stay in touch with Primera Liga leaders Real Madrid. Messi (left) is congratulated by Ronaldinho after scoring again in Barcelona's 3-0 win over Atletico Madrid. Barcelona had thumped Atletico 6-0 on their own ground last season and the visitors were out for revenge -- but conceded twice in four minutes. After 15 minutes, Italian goalkeeper Christian Abbiati let a routine Messi cross slip out of his hands and Deco rolled home into the empty net. Four minutes later Messi played a great one-two with Ronaldinho and rifled a shot past Abbiati for his sixth goal of the season and Xavi added a third late on. ""It was a deserved victory against a rival that we have had problems with in the past,"" explained Barca coach Frank Rijkaard. ""We scored twice in quick succession and then we controlled the match using aggression and with the team attacking and defending as a unit."" ""Conceding two early goals inside four minutes is not easy to turn around especially against Barcelona,"" admitted Atletico coach Javier Aguirre. It was Barcelona's fourth straight league win but they still trail Real Madrid by two points after the champions beat Recreativo Huleva 2-0. Dutch international Ruud van Nistelrooy, the league's top-scorer last season, scored on 72 minutes before Gonzalo Higuain netted in the final minute to keep Real at the summit. Luck deserted them when Wesley Sneijder hit the post but Van Nistelrooy scored in the final quarter hour before Higuain struck to keep them two points clear at the top. Real have made their best start since 1991 but coach Bernd Schuster's rotation policy has been questioned with the German chopping and changing his team. ""It was an important victory because it is the final match before we go away on international duty,"" said Dutch winger Arjen Robben. ""We are now top for the next two weeks and can build on that when we return."" Villarreal, now four points behind Real, lost for only the second time in 15 matches with a 3-2 reverse against Osasuna. Sevilla, third last season, are in a crisis after losing their fourth league game in a row with a goal from Riki handing Deportivo La Coruna a surprise 1-0 win.

"(CNN) -- After weeks of controversy over Michael Mukasey's views on waterboarding, the Senate late Thursday approved the former judge's nomination for attorney general by a 53-40 vote. Waterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bush's nominee to lead the Justice Department. President Bush nominated Mukasey to replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales, who resigned in September. The nomination had been considered at risk after a number of Democratic senators opposed Mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Mukasey, a former federal judge in New York, told senators he considers waterboarding ""repugnant,"" but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture, which U.S. and international law bans. Waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning. Mukasey's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York -- said they would vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy. ""The Department of Justice, once the crown jewel among government institutions, is adrift and rudderless,"" Schumer said Tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11-8 to send Mukasey's nomination to the Senate floor. ""It desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and I believe Judge Mukasey is that person."" Schumer said that in a meeting Friday the nominee said that Congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president ""would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore"" it. Schumer said he believed Mukasey would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general. ""Indeed, his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president's previous attorney general nominees have."" But Mukasey's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's chairman. ""Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey's personal assurance that he would enforce a future, new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to pass one,"" Leahy said Tuesday. ""Unsaid, of course, is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president."" However, the committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he believed Mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding. ""He could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances,"" Specter said earlier. ""But he is intelligent; he's really learned in the law. He's strong, ethical, honest beyond any question. He's not an intimate of the president."" A majority of Americans consider waterboarding a form of torture, but some of those say it's OK for the U.S. government to use the technique, according to a poll released Tuesday. Asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture, more than two-thirds of respondents, or 69 percent, said yes; 29 percent said no. Asked whether they think the U.S. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists, 58 percent said no; 40 percent said yes. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. telephone poll of 1,024 American adults was carried out over the weekend and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"He said the crowd had reached the Washington monument as he spoke at the US Capitol, despite photographic evidence to the contrary. Later, his White House press secretary said it had been ""the largest audience to ever see an inauguration, period"". On Saturday, millions in the US and around the world protested against Mr Trump's new administration. The largest US rally was in the capital Washington, which city officials estimated to be more than 500,000-strong. By most estimates, it surpassed the crowd at Friday's inauguration. The aim was mainly to highlight women's rights, which activists believe to be under threat from the new administration. Mr Trump did not mention the protests during a bridge-building visit to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Saturday but instead turned on the press. He accused the media of inventing a feud between him and the intelligence community and he called reporters ""among the most dishonest human beings on earth"". Mr Trump said TV footage and photos of his inauguration had painted an inaccurate picture. ""It looked like a million and a half people"" there on Friday, he said, rubbishing media reports that there were as few as 250,000 people. He also said the crowd extended all the way back to the Washington Monument, although this claim is contradicted by aerial shots from the day. Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer berated reporters at a news conference over photographs that had shown large, empty spaces during the ceremony. ""This was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe,"" he said in a fiery statement. ""These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm about the inauguration are shameful and wrong."" In addition to the photographic evidence, Washington's Metro system said trips were down on previous inaugurations. Marketing firm Nielsen said television views in the US were less than Barack Obama's and Ronald Reagan's first inaugurations. Mr Spicer, who did not take questions, added: ""There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable, and I'm here to tell you it goes two ways. We're going to hold the press accountable as well."" Outgoing CIA chief John Brennan accused Mr Trump of ""a despicable display of self-aggrandisement"" over the statement at Langley. ""Former CIA Director Brennan is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump's despicable display of self-aggrandisement in front of CIA's Memorial Wall of agency heroes,"" his former deputy, Nick Shapiro, said in a statement carried by CNN. ""Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself."" Last week, Mr Brennan called on Mr Trump to be more ""disciplined"" in what he said and warned him not to underestimate Russian intentions. Mr Trump's visit had sought to mend relations with the intelligence community after weeks of doubting their conclusions about alleged Russian interference into the US election. ""I love you, I respect you,"" he said, adding that he was ""1,000%"" behind the spy agency. Mr Trump said the media had invented a feud between them, although in a recent row over a leaked dossier that alleged the Kremlin held compromising material on him, he had likened the actions of intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany. Mr Trump's election has divided opinion in the US and around the world. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, writing in Bild newspaper on Sunday, warned that the world was headed ""for turbulent times."" ""With the election of Donald Trump, the world of the 20th century has definitely been overtaken,"" he said.",formal
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- State Department officials should serve where they are needed -- even in war-torn Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says that ""people need to serve where they are needed."" Rice was responding to foreign service officers' objections to the possibility of ""directed assignments"" in Iraq. The issue has caused an uproar in the State Department, resulting in a contentious town hall-style meeting Wednesday. The new directives would be needed if enough qualified foreign service officers don't step forward to fill open positions at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. If the State Department enforces directed assignments, it will be the first time since the Vietnam War era. One official called the order to serve in Iraq ""a potential death sentence"" during the town meeting. The State Department already has begun notifying about 200 people considered prime candidates. Those chosen will be given 10 days to respond, according to last week's announcement. Unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse, those who decline could face dismissal, it said. Wednesday's heated meeting was replayed on an internal State Department television channel in Washington several times and talked about widely. Some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly, learning about it instead from news organizations last week. Watch the diplomats exchange angry words » . ""I just have no respect for the whole process because you've demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues,"" said foreign service officer Jack Croddy. ""Thank you for that comment. It's full of inaccuracies, but that's OK,"" Harry Thomas Jr., director general of the foreign service, shot back. Others pointed out the risks of such assignments, considering the dangers of a war zone, lack of security and regular rocket attacks on U.S. personnel. Rice, who did not attend the meeting, tried to calm things down Friday by underscoring the State Department's attempts to do ""everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats."" However, she said, ""This is one of the highest priority tasks of the United States, and we're going to meet our obligations."" Speaking to reporters en route to Turkey and the Mideast, she said, ""I don't know if we will have direct assignments or not, but we are one foreign service, and people need to serve where they are needed."" The secretary sent out a cable to State Department employees worldwide encouraging them to serve in Iraq. ""This year [U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker] has identified the need for additional positions to more effectively accomplish our mission in Iraq,"" Rice said in the cable. Rice said she has decided to go forward with the identification of officers to serve, ""should it prove necessary to direct assignments."" ""Should others step forward, as some already have, we will fill these new jobs as we have before -- with volunteers. However, regardless of how the jobs may be filled, they must be filled,"" she said. Rice earlier said reports that the State Department was finding it hard to coax foreign service employees into Iraq ""couldn't be further from the truth."" The assignments are new positions. Fifteen people have stepped forward to volunteer for Iraq service since the new policy was announced October 26, department spokesman Sean McCormack said. McCormack rejected comments by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, that State Department employees are ""nervous Nellies"" and that wounded U.S. military veterans should be asked to fill the Iraq vacancies. McCormack said until now the State Department has been successful in filling jobs in Iraq with volunteers. Since 2003, more than 1,500 personnel have volunteered to go to Iraq, he said. But with the expansion of the staff in Iraq this year, 58 spots were left open. ""They are serving in dangerous and challenging places,"" he said. ""We have a lot of brave people who are stepping up to the plate in Anbar and Basra and Baghdad and Kabul and a lot of other places that are not necessarily in the headlines."" State Department employees have been killed in Iraq, but McCormack could not say how many. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Zain Verjee and Charley Keyes contributed to this report.",formal

"(Real Simple) -- Here are five great ways to enjoy your summer. Lazing in a hammock is one of the best ways to spend a summer evening. Best way to cut jeans into shorts -- What better way to declare the start of summer? The key to cutting off jeans is not to go too short too soon. Slip on the jeans and mark the desired length on one leg with chalk. ""Take them off, fold the leg at the mark, and iron the fold,"" says Caroline Calvin, creative director of Levi's. ""Then cut just under the crease with fabric scissors. Lay the short jean leg on top of the other side and cut to evenly match."" Repeat as needed to get the length you want. Ninety-degree days? Bring 'em on! The best way to catch fireflies -- How? With womanly wiles: ""Fireflies blink to attract a mate,"" explains naturalist Lynn Havsall, director of programs at the George B. Dorr Museum of Natural History, in Bar Harbor, Maine. ""Males fly around while females sit in trees, in shrubs, or on the ground. So find a female and watch her blinking pattern. Then imitate the pattern with a pen flashlight and the males will come to you."" ]A plus: The bugs move slowly, so they're easy to trap in a jar. Punch some holes in the lid and add a little grass and a piece of fruit for moisture. Admire your pretty night-lights till bedtime, then let them go. The best way to run on the beach -- Who needs a treadmill when you have miles of shoreline? Running on the beach can get you into great shape. Take it from lifeguard Benjamin Guss, 25, of Del Mar, California, who recently qualified to compete in this year's Iron Man triathlon (yes, that means swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles, and then running a marathon -- consecutively) in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Beware, shoeless Joes. If you choose to run barefoot, keep your workouts brief at first to allow tender soles to build up calluses. ""You can get blisters, even burns, from hot, soft sand,"" says Guss. ""I like to run barefoot, but for more than a couple miles, I wear shoes."" Know your sand. ""In soft sand, one mile is like two,"" says Guss. You may work foot and leg muscles you don't always use, so start slowly. And hard sand can be as tough on your legs as the road, so wear running sneakers. Pick the right time to run. ""My favorite time is in the evening,"" says Guss. ""The wind dies down, and the sand isn't that hot."" To work harder, fill small bags with sand to use as hand weights. The best way to get in and out of a hammock -- Everyone looks good lazing in a hammock -- it's getting in and out that's tricky. To make it less so, try these tips from Penny Waugh, a buyer for http://www.hammocks.com/. • Position your backside toward the hammock's center and tilt back until you reach a 45-degree angle, with the hammock parallel to your rear. • Gently sit back into the hammock and let it level out. • Swing your legs up and stretch them out. • Lie back. Loll. Sigh contentedly. For a graceful exit, sit upright and swing your legs off, anchoring your feet on the ground. Then push with your behind, gathering momentum to stand. ""It's tricky, since there's nothing to hold on to,"" says Waugh. ""But it's good for the glutes."" The best way to tie espadrilles -- Apply this lace-up logic from Meghan Cleary, author of ""The Perfect Fit: What Your Shoes Say About You."" • Slide your foot fully into the shoe and plant it firmly on the floor. • Cross and tie the laces once behind the ankle, then bring them forward, cross and tie again, and continue up the leg, depending on how long the laces are. The calf is the maximum height -- any higher and you'll look like a gladiator. • Each time you cross and tie, secure the laces slightly tighter than is comfortable, since they will loosen a bit when you walk. Just don't cut off your circulation. • For a streamlined leg, make the final tie in the back. Create a more whimsical look by putting the final tie in front with a small bow. E-mail to a friend .

"The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline ""deserved better"". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: ""After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before."" Labour majority: 2,873 Turnout 24,200 - 42.65% Swing: 6.94% from SNP to Labour And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: ""We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. ""Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession."" The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. ""We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open,"" she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: ""I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline."" Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: ""When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives.""

"I'm fairly certain I understood your point correctly: keeping gay men out of the BSA is doing nothing to protect the scouts since they're apparently still being molested. Therefore it's stupid to assume the gay men are the cause of the molestation. Please correct me if I am wrong. If I understand you correctly, I whole-heartedly agree. I just want to add: I know it's not intuitive, but the majority of child molesters, even those who target boys, are not gay. (I say it's not intuitive because the boys are still male, not because I think all gay men like little boys. Sources disagree on why they target boys, but many experts agree its simply because of ease-of-access.) I did a paper that included this subject in school and I read a few studies that all pretty much agreed that gay men are less likely to molest children than straight men. The numbers are about .5% to 2% of child molesters are homosexual, and while the numbers differ depending on who you ask, roughly 2% to 10% of Americans identify as gay. This means that your child is either less likely or just as likely to get diddled by a gay scout leader as he is a straight scout leader. But he is definitely not *more* likely to get molested by a gay scout leader. Tl;dr: So yeah, gay men, according to statistics, should totally be allowed to be scout leaders.",informal

"NEW ALBANY, Indiana (CNN) -- President Bush vetoed a $600 billion spending bill Tuesday, accusing Democratic leaders of wasting money and plotting tax increases, then took his budget fight with Congress on the road. Congress should cut spending ""and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,"" President Bush said. ""The majority was elected on a pledge of fiscal responsibility, but so far, it's acting like a teenager with a new credit card,"" he said in a speech in New Albany, Indiana. The bill -- which Bush said was laden with $10 billion in ""pork"" -- would have funded the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services. It also would have funded projects such as a prison museum, a sailing school and a program to teach Portuguese. ""Congress needs to cut out that pork, reduce the spending and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,"" the president said. Watch a report on the veto » . While polls show Bush's popularity remains at near-record lows, Congress ranks even lower as a whole. The president has taken numerous opportunities to mock the spending habits of the Democratic leadership and force confrontations over the appropriations bills needed to fund the government for the 2008 budget year, which began October 1. The bill Bush vetoed Tuesday includes about $150 billion to run those departments and more than $450 billion in mandatory spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health care programs for the elderly and poor, according to the House Appropriations Committee. The committee's chairman, Rep. David Obey, called Bush's veto ""not responsible and not credible."" ""This is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 Republicans,"" Obey, D-Wisconsin, said in a statement issued after the veto. ""There has been virtually no criticism of its contents. It is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics."" Bush said Democrats are supporting $22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases. ""When the bill for all that spending comes due, Congress is going to turn to the working people, to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs,"" he said. Tuesday's veto is the fifth cast since Democrats took control of Congress in 2006. Congress has overridden one of those, voting last week to authorize $23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president's objections. Democrats will schedule another override vote this week, an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. But Antonia Ferrier, spokeswoman for House Republican Whip Roy Blunt, said Bush's GOP allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto. Bush signed a $470 billion Pentagon spending bill that covers the Defense Department's normal operations, but Democrats split $50 billion in spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan off into a ""bridge fund"" to which they plan to attach demands for Bush to withdraw U.S. combat troops. The measure sets up another confrontation with the White House. Bush also demanded Congress reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes, but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue. He said a plan proposed by Rep. Charles Rangel, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to eliminate the tax was unacceptable. ""Preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas,"" he said. ""Congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the AMT relief to my desk as soon as possible."" The elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $800 billion to be lost over 10 years. To replace that, Rangel's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $100,000, after deductions, and close corporate tax loopholes. The bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers. Republicans have already started calling it ""the mother of all tax increases."" ""With all the other pressures on our economy, raising taxes is one of the most unwise things Congress could possibly do,"" Bush said. Bush acknowledged the difficulties Americans face from high fuel prices, a ""challenged"" housing market and ""uncertainty"" in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- ""but as we have seen in recent years, this economy is resilient, and that's important for the American people to understand.""

"Mr Menezes, an electrician who was fatally shot at Stockwell Tube station in south London on 22 July 2005 by officers who mistook him for a suicide bomber, arrived in the UK from Brazil in 2002. He had joined an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Brazilians - including some relatives - in London and quickly learnt to speak English. The son of bricklayer Matosinhos Otoni da Silva, Mr Menezes was born in the town of Gonzaga in the state of Minas Gerais - a source of many migrants to Europe and the US. He spent his childhood living in an adobe hut in the town. Mr Silva told BBC News his son had always wanted to be an electrician - as a child, he would make electrical toys with batteries, copper and matchboxes. Mr Menezes moved to Sao Paulo to live with his uncle at the age of 14, attended high school and became a qualified electrician. His father said Mr Menezes had always had a desire to move abroad to earn money. ""When he was a child he said: 'Father, I heard on the radio people make good money in England, the United States, France. If I have money to go, I will go. I will take advantage of my age and my energy to help you out.'"" About half of the young people from Gonzaga move abroad in the hope of securing a better future. The Home Office said Mr Menezes had been granted entry to the UK for six months as a visitor on his arrival on 13 March 2002. He then applied for leave to remain as a student, which was approved. He was granted leave to remain until 30 June 2003. The Home Office says his visa expired at that time and that he remained illegally in the UK until his death. Like many Brazilians in London, Mr Menezes would send money home to his parent's modest farm in Gonzaga. ""He didn't make a lot of money,"" his father said. ""Most of his money went on rent and food. ""He wanted to stay for another two years to save money so he could come back and invest in a ranch."" He said his son was happy in London. Friends say Mr Menezes was as shocked as all Londoners by the 7 July 2005 Tube and bus bombings, as well as the attempted London public transport attacks on Thursday 21 July - the day before he was shot. Gésio César D'avila, a friend and colleague, said Mr Menezes had considered alternative transport after the failed attacks. ""We were together on Thursday, and when we saw what happened, Jean said he wanted to buy a motorbike to avoid the Tube,"" he said. On 22 July, the day Mr Menezes was killed, police and soldiers had been watching the block of flats in Tulse Hill, where the electrician lived. They believed Hussain Osman, one of the failed 21 July bombers, was living there. What they did not immediately realise was that the flats shared a communal entrance. It is thought Mr Menezes left his flat, which he shared with cousins Vivian and Patricia, in order to fit a fire alarm. Undercover police officers began following Mr Menezes because they thought he looked like Osman. He took a bus to Stockwell station, where he boarded a train. There he was pinned down and shot seven times in the head and once in the shoulder by two officers trained in stopping suicide bombers. Police were later to say the officers had feared for their own lives and for those of other passengers on the train. In the days that followed the shooting, a makeshift memorial to Mr Menezes was set up outside Stockwell Tube station. The shrine of flowers, candles, pictures and newspaper articles became a gathering point for campaigners seeking answers over the incident. Almost a year after his death, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that no officers would be prosecuted, but the Met Police would be tried for breaching health and safety laws. On 1 November 2007, the force was found guilty at the Old Bailey of endangering the public over the operation that led to the shooting and fined £175,000 with £385,000 costs. A jury found the force broke health and safety laws when officers pursued Mr Menezes and shot him seven times An inquest into Mr Menezes death began on 22 October 2008. The jury rejected the police account Mr de Menezes was killed lawfully by two officers and returned an open verdict. The coroner had instructed the jury not to return a verdict of unlawful killing, and gave it the choice of two possible verdicts. The Met Police settled a damages claim with Mr Menezes family in 2009. The amount of compensation the family will receive was not disclosed. In January 2010, Menezes family members and campaigners gathered at Stockwell station on what would have been his 32nd birthday to unveil a permanent memorial. A colourful mosaic framing a photograph of Mr Menezes was created by local artist Mary Edwards.",formal
"Pre-tax profits fell to £78.7m in the first six months of the year, down 35% from £121.8m a year earlier. It paid an additional £44m in gambling duties, following changes to the taxation of online betting and fixed-odds betting terminals. William Hill also said it had bought a 29.4% stake in online lottery firm NeoGames for $25m (£16m). Shares in the bookmaker had fallen more than 7% by late morning. In December last year, a new Point of Consumption Tax came into effect, which applies to gambling profits generated from UK customers. In addition, Machine Games Duty - the levy paid on fixed-odds betting terminals - was increased to 25% in March. The company's chief executive, James Henderson, said: ""We have delivered a good operational performance in the past six months during a period of significant regulatory and taxation change for the industry. ""Whilst factors such as the Point of Consumption Tax and the increase in the Machine Games Duty rate have impacted our cost base as expected, we continue to progress our strategy and invest in our long-term growth drivers."" William Hill's profits were also hit by one-off costs relating to the rebranding of its operations in Australia. The fall in profit came despite a slight increase in net revenues to £808.1m from £805.2m a year earlier. The bookmaker also said that the introduction of the government's National Living Wage would cost it about £1m-£2m in 2016. Referring to William Hill's purchase of the stake in NeoGames, Mr Henderson described the online lottery market as an ""exciting opportunity"". NeoGames' business is focused on the US, where lottery spending per head is the highest in the world, William Hill said. The UK firm also has an option to buy the remaining 70.6% of NeoGames, which it can exercise after either three or five years.",formal

"(CNN) -- This week MME speaks to the man charged with boosting growth in the Kingdom of Bahrain: Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa. Sheikh Mohammed is concerned the nuclear dispute with Iran is deterring potential investors . As chief executive of the Economic Development Board, one of Sheikh Mohammed's main tasks is to ensure Bahrain stays ahead of its competitors. The government's pushing ahead with economic reforms to reduce the Kingdom's dependence on oil. But with crude prices near $100 a barrel, John Defterios asked whether the appetite for change had diminished. SM: The reforms are being done for aspirational reasons rather than necessity, so we are trying to enter the post-oil area because we want to. And therefore, because of this aspirational aspect, trying to get to as opposed to people pushing us somewhere we don't want to go. JD: How do you redefine Bahrain's role? Traditionally it's been a financial center, but you have Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Dubai even Abu Dhabi emerging in financial services. How you redefine it to sustain a lead? SM: The rising tide lifts a lot of places and as the region is booming and growing, financial services are growing throughout the region. Bahrain's strengths have been and will continue to be its human capital, the people that have led the financial sector and the long standing regulations that have been established in Bahrain. JD: Strategically and a geopolitical question here: the Crown Prince came out and declared what Iran's intentions really are -- in his view -- for a nuclear policy, and called for greater diplomacy right ahead of a visit by the President of Iran to the country. What's the motivation here? SM: We feel that the distraction caused by the Iranian nuclear issue is holding investment back in the region as a whole, and increasing the security threat of the region. Nobody is debating the right to peaceful nuclear power, but we all have that need and we all need a peaceful resolution to this. JD: Historically, Iran has even made claims against Bahrain, what do you do now moving forward now? Do you bring Russia, China, the United States and the European Union closer together, in terms of where we should be going in the future? SM: We've resolved our historical issue with Iran, and we are well beyond that, but going forward... This is such a important issue affecting security worldwide, that we feel it is important and at a level high enough that we need all powers involved because it does affect everybody. JD: Can the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) become much tighter as an organization to have a voice in that process; as opposed to speaking from the sidelines and hoping that the major powers move forward? SM: Absolutely, I mean, the GCC is speaking with a unified voice. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came out with a proposal for providing nuclear fuel from an independent authority; this was completely backed from the GCC. We are all moving forward and are willing to play a beneficial role to resolve this issue. Meet the Sheikh: . Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa is chief executive of the Economic Development Board, the organization responsible for stimulating and supporting growth of the Bahraini economy. He was appointed in June 2005, following 10 years working directly for His Highness Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince, Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defense Force and Chairman of the Economic Development Board. From 1995 to 1999, he was director of the Crown Prince's office. In 1999, he was appointed head of the court and also deputy head of the Crown Prince's International Scholarship Program. During this time, Sheikh Mohammed was heavily involved with the Crown Prince's initiatives to liberalize the telecommunications sector and with labor market and economic reforms. A keen motor sports enthusiast, Sheikh Mohammed was deputy board chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit and is a former vice president of the Bahrain Motor Club, now known as the Bahrain Motor Federation. Sheikh Mohammed, who is married with two sons and one daughter, was born on April 14, 1969. In 1992, he received a bachelor's degree in economic theory from the American University, Washington DC. Two years later, he received a post-graduate diploma in business studies from the London School of Economics. (source: Bahrain Economic Development Board) E-mail to a friend .",formal

"(CNN) -- Officials are searching for the driver of a white truck seen on Santiago Canyon Road on Sunday, near the time the Santiago fire started, Orange County authorities said Friday. Chief Chip Prather holds a photo of a white truck similar to the one seen on Santiago Canyon Road. ""These people are not suspects at this time,"" Orange County Fire Authority Chief Chip Prather said. ""They are persons of interest who were seen near the fire in a vehicle like this."" The vehicle is a white, 1998 to 2004 Ford F150 pickup with chrome tubular running boards. Prather said the information came from a lead called into the investigation's tip line. A $250,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the blaze. Watch how residents feel about arsonist » . The Santiago fire, now 27,000 acres and still burning, was deliberately set, officials said Thursday. Several mandatory evacuations remain in place for the Santiago fire, which has destroyed 14 homes and various other structures. Late Friday afternoon, the blaze moved into Silverado Canyon, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies were evacuating residents in the fire's path. Watch the Santiago flames rage » . Authorities also suspect arson in the Rosa fire in San Diego County, which burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained. There was no information on the investigation. Elsewhere, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office filed arson charges Friday against a 41-year-old Sun Valley man who witnesses said set a fire in the West Hills neighborhood and walked away. Catalino Pineda is one of five people who have been arrested in arson investigations this week, but none of them has been linked to the major wildfires raging across Southern California. Pineda was arrested Wednesday after witnesses said they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside, police said. The fire was quickly extinguished. The witnesses followed Pineda to a nearby restaurant and called police, who arrested him. Pineda was expected to be arraigned in Van Nuys Superior Court Friday, Deputy District Attorney Steven Frankland said. He is charged with one count of arson of a structure or forest. Pineda is being held on $75,000 bail and faces up to six years in prison if convicted. In San Bernardino, east of Los Angeles, John Rund, of Hesperia, was arrested Wednesday on arson charges after a witness reported seeing him in brush near the starting point of a fire Tuesday, the sheriff's department said. That fire was quickly put out by passers-by. Investigators are trying to determine if Rund, 48, may have ties to other wildfires. He is being held on $750,000 bail. The San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office on Thursday filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands. A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on $250,000 bail. In San Diego County, the sheriff's department this week arrested an adult and a juvenile allegedly seen by an anonymous tipster starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county. In a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava. The Vista fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said. Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 11,675-acre Slide fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said. More than 1,600 homes have been destroyed in the past week by Southern California wildfires. E-mail to a friend .",formal

BUPA began as The British United Provident Association in 1947 to preserve freedom of choice in health care. It believed that with a National Health Service being introduced a year later, there would still be a need for a complimentary service enabling people from all walks of life to afford the benefits of choice in where, when and by whom they were treated. Led by the growing public demand for health care and a lack of quality private accommodation BUPA initiated the Nuffield Homes Charitable Trust - later renamed Nuffield Hospitals. BUPA's biggest and original business is health insurance in the UK, both for individuals and corporations that want to look after the health of their employees. More than half of the UK's top companies are BUPA customers.

"Pte Paul Wilkinson said he asked Pte Cheryl James to choose one of her lovers and pick him or her boyfriend. The inquest in Woking was told Pte Wilkinson and Pte James had been caught in bed by her boyfriend Sapper Simeon Carr-Minns, known then as Jim. Pte James was found dead with a bullet wound to the head in November 1995. The 18-year-old from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was one of four recruits to die at the base in seven years. Mr Wilkinson, then aged 16, said he spoke to Pte James about 20 minutes before he heard she had died. He said: ""I just remember saying 'pick one of us, if you want to be friends that would be fine if you want to stay with him'. She said that she did not."" Mr Wilkinson said he did not try to avoid being seen while the pair talked and he was just sitting in a chair in the cabin while she was on guard duty. He was eventually seen by a major and told to leave because he should not have been with Pte James while she was on duty, the inquest heard. He said the officer ""pretty much escorted me back to the barracks"". The major has previously told the inquest that he did not march Mr Wilkinson off. The inquest heard that was the last time Mr Wilkinson saw Pte James. He also told the hearing about his anger and upset after Mr Carr-Minns caught him in bed with Pte James, days before she died. He said Pte James told him then she was splitting up with Mr Carr-Minns. Alison Foster QC, representing the James family, suggested to Mr Wilkinson he was ""not just angry"" but ""humiliated"" when Mr Carr-Minns turned up because other people who were also in the room began to tease and laugh at him. Mr Wilkinson said being caught in bed by her boyfriend ""is not what you want"". Ms Foster then told Mr Wilkinson the major was certain he had not marched him away and asked: ""Were you aware that you needed to sort out some sort of alibi?"" Mr Wilkinson said he had always given the same account but the other officer remembered it differently. Ms Foster then recalled a statement from December 2002 in which Mr Wilkinson commented that if he had not been forced off the grounds he could have been facing a murder charge and been in prison. But Mr Wilkinson denied he had tipped Pte James over the edge. Ms Foster took Mr Wilkinson through differences in statements he has made and said: ""Your story gets more and more elaborate as time goes by. ""Your upset and humiliation gave you a motive to be seriously angry with Cheryl. ""Is it the case you have been less than truthful for your reason for going to see her on Monday morning?"" But Mr Wilkinson replied: ""No that is not true. I have said all that I remembered."" Mr Wilkinson was asked if he saw Pte James sitting by a tree, if either of them had messed with her rifle, if he saw an accident happen to her, if he was present when the trigger was pulled, and if he heard the shot - he replied ""no"" to each question. He had earlier denied he got violent when angry but Ms Foster pointed out he put someone's head through an arcade machine when he thought they were laughing about Pte James's death. Mr Wilkinson said he had been pushed to breaking point and added: ""I think any other person would have done the same thing."" A first inquest into Pte James's death in December 1995 recorded an open verdict. This second inquest was ordered after High Court judges quashed the original findings. The hearing continues.",formal

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Three Chinese nationals accused of importing thousands of counterfeit luxury handbags in the United States have been arrested in the past two days, federal authorities announced Thursday. Shoppers sort through counterfeit brand name luxury bags and wallets on a Hong Kong street. ""This was a sophisticated criminal conspiracy that trafficked millions of dollars of counterfeit goods from China, profiting off the backs of legitimate companies and their hard-working employees,"" said Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher. Authorities call it one of the largest counterfeit operations ever discovered, involving about 300,000 bags and wallets with names like Burberry, Gucci and Coach. For customers who bought the knockoffs, it seemed like a deal. They paid a total of about $16 million for what would have been more than $100 million in handbags, purses and wallets in legitimate retail sales. The alleged leaders of the counterfeit operations are three Chinese citizens living in New York. Chong Lam, 49, and Joyce Chan, 39, were arrested there Wednesday. Eric Yuen, 39, was arrested Thursday in Las Vegas, Nevada. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who made the arrests began investigating the alleged scheme five years ago, after raids turned up counterfeit goods. The indictment was secretly returned in Richmond, Virginia, in October. The charges were unsealed when the alleged conspirators were taken into custody. Authorities seized and froze 29 bank accounts and three New York properties. The Chinese defendants will be taken to Richmond, where they will be arraigned at a later date, officials said.

"British Gas unveiled a 5.1% price reduction, followed swiftly by EDF's announcement of a 5% cut. British Gas's price change takes effect on 16 March, while EDF's kicks in eight days later. The moves benefit customers on a standard domestic gas tariff. Britain's big six energy suppliers have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers after a 57% drop in wholesale gas prices since this time last year. E.On was the first to announce a cut this year of 5.1%, followed by similar reductions by SSE, Scottish Power and Npower. Executive director at consumer group Which?, Richard Lloyd, said :""Seeing all of the big suppliers mirror each other with small cuts in the face of falling wholesale prices will raise questions in many people's minds about whether competition is working in this market."" British Gas, which is owned by Centrica, said 6.8 million of its customers on dual-fuel deals would see an average annual saving of Â£31 due to the 5.1% cut. It said customers on so-called ""fix and fall"" tariffs would also benefit from the price reduction. EDF said about 900,000 of its customers would also make an annual saving of Â£31. It said it had no exit fees on any of its fixed deals. Beatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF, said: ""Our prices are under constant review and today's announcement reflects falls in wholesale gas costs."" Centrica's Mark Hodges, chief executive of its energy supply and services in UK and Ireland, said: ""Competitive pricing is the way to retain existing customers and win new business in this hard-fought market."" Some commentators warn that these types of ""standard"" tariffs are among the most expensive, so there is still benefit in shopping around. Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, said: ""These price cuts are a movement in the right direction for loyal customers, but they are dwarfed by the savings available by switching from a standard tariff to a fixed deal. ""You could save more money, up to Â£300, by switching."" There was also criticism of the industry for failing to cut electricity tariffs, despite falling wholesale costs. Energy analysts at Jefferies said: ""There has still been no movement in electricity tariffs, despite a 30% fall in wholesale electricity prices since August 2014. ""This is likely due to increased environmental costs, which fall on electricity rather than gas, and additional network charges."" British Gas said it was unable to lower electricity prices due to rising costs, such as for network delivery, adding that wholesale costs only make up a third of electricity bills. Energy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd said there was still more to do.

(2) Article 21(5) of the Europe Agreement provides that the Community and Romania is to examine product by product and on an orderly and reciprocal basis the possibilities of granting each other further concessions. (3) The first improvements to the preferential arrangements of the Europe Agreement with Romania were provided for in the Protocol for the adaptation of the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement to take into account the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the European Union and the results of the agricultural negotiations of the Uruguay Round, including improvements to the existing preferential regime, approved by Council Decision 98/626/EC(2). (4) Improvements to the preferential arrangements were also provided for as a result of negotiations to liberalise agricultural trade concluded in 2000. On the Community side, these were implemented from 1 July 2000 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2435/2000 of 17 October 2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Romania(3). This second adjustment of the preferential arrangements has not yet been incorporated in the Europe Agreement in the form of an Additional Protocol. (5) Negotiations for further improvements to the preferential arrangements of the Europe Agreement with Romania were concluded on 18 June 2002. (6) The new Protocol to the Europe Agreement adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part (hereinafter referred to as the Protocol) should be approved with a view to consolidating all concessions in agricultural trade between the two sides, including the results of the negotiations concluded in 2000 and 2002. (7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(4) has codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations. Certain tariff quotas under this Decision should therefore be administered in accordance with those rules. (8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5). (9) As a result of the aforementioned negotiations, Regulation (EC) No 2435/2000 has been superseded and should therefore be repealed, HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Article 1 The Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the Parties on new mutual agricultural concessions, is hereby approved on behalf of the European Community.

"That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species. The hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree. This suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom. This argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship. Nonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue. ""We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,"" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Science Advances. They then mapped blueness onto that evolutionary tree, based on a bank of tarantula snaps scoured from the internet. ""If the genus has at least one species that's blue, we say that's a blue genus,"" Mr Hsiung explained. Given that scattering of blue species, he added, they then calculated ""the lowest number of changes that can produce a distribution of blue colouring like this"". The answer? ""Eight is the lowest number, so it's [evolved] at least eight times."" What is more, all these blue spiders evolved almost precisely the same shade; the wavelengths the team saw in the images all fell within a tight 20 nanometre range, clustered around 450nm - a bright, cobalt blue. The team also purchased specimens of eight tarantula species, and took a close look at those blue hairs. They used electron microscopes to zoom in on tiny shapes within the hairs and conducted simulations of how those shapes could produce a ""structural colour"" by reflecting - very specifically - this wavelength of blue light. The results, again, pointed to the colour cropping up multiple times independently: several different types of shape could be seen, even on the same branch of the family tree. ""That's one of the reasons why it must have evolved so many times - because we don't see a very clear pattern of how these different mechanisms split,"" Mr Hsiung said. ""If we could see a clear split, then it might have evolved just one or two times. But it's all over the place."" So why did all these different species acquire the same colour? Given their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour. That is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider. ""It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,"" Mr Hsiung said. ""That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function. ""But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there."" It may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten. ""We don't know yet,"" Mr Hsiung said. Follow Jonathan on Twitter",formal

"East Sussex Healthcare Trust which runs the Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital is currently rated as ""inadequate"". However, BBC South East Today has learned the trust has failed to improve and is likely to be placed into special measures at a meeting on Friday. The trust said it was awaiting a report to be published and would not comment. The other trusts currently in special measures include East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Medway NHS Foundation Trust. Medway's Maritime Hospital was forced to turn away ambulances earlier, and on Wednesday, to help ease the burden on its A&E department. The East Sussex trust was rated as ""inadequate"" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in March, after failing to meeting government targets. In May, it was criticised by Eastbourne Borough Council, which passed a vote of no confidence in its management. And in July the chief executive resigned while the trust had to apologise after patients' details were found in the street. Leadership would appear to be the big problem at this trust. In its March report, the CQC described a ""disconnect between the trust board and it's staff"" and a ""culture where staff were afraid to speak out"". The trust's problems have been well documented but what has apparently been lacking is any real progress in putting things right. It's my understanding the CQC feel very little has improved in the last few months. Friday's meeting between all the stakeholders will be a chance to discuss the way forward but many people I have spoken to in the wider NHS believe special measures will be imposed on the trust. A spokesman for the trust refused to comment on whether it would be put into special measures. He said: ""We are waiting for the publication of the CQC report next week and until it is published and they have made any recommendation we are unable to make any further comment.""",formal

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A wide-open presidential race and a willingness by candidates, interest groups, unions and corporations to buy TV time will lead to historic spending for political and issue-advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle, an analysis shows. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year » . And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups ""pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode."" ""What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,"" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle. Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending » . In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys. Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials. Richardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate. Romney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses. While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. ""Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,"" Tracey said. ""As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot."" In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as $639 million could be spent on television advertising. Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that CMAG's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. ""Politics is completely beholden to events,"" he said. ""Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when."" What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months? ""Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. ""The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance. After a while, the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise.""

"Your mileage may vary, but generally it's considered bad to mess with your hormones without a doctors guidance. Although possible and also possibly safe, there's still a chance you could do a lot of harm than good - that's the chance you take. I've heard good and bad about it. People achieving the results they wanted or minor effects that were desired with minimal to no bad side effects. I don't know if ""bad for your liver"" is the right term, rather you're putting more hormones, more ""stuff"" into your blood and your liver and kidney's have to work harder because they have a certain level programmed into them they want to maintain. That being said, liver or kidney's that work harder are more likely to fail. The only true advice i'd offer is, it's really up to you. If you do decide bone up on the subject, /r/asktransgender has a lot of self medicated posts (posts for both full on transition and minor changes). I'd like to add, there's a lot of non invasive things you could do to help promote more feminine changes. Getting plenty of rest, lots of water, regularly changing sheets and pillow cases more often, moisturizing, etc are all the little things I do and my skin has softened and cleared up quite a bit. I drink a lot of tea, specifically wintergreen tea, helps make my skin not so oily. I mean it still is but it helps, and whether or not it's placebo, i believe the tea helps with it. TL;DR Do what you gotta do to feel happy/content with your self but be sure to read up before you do things that could do more harm than good. /r/asktransgender has a lot more helpful folks on the topic of home supplements for full transitions as well as minor changes.

"I'm going to disagree here. I think Moffat has run the show in a great direction since being made showrunner. The problem with bringing RTD back is that he was, in my opinion, a much better showrunner than a writer. His direction on keeping the show a certain way with episodes not written by himself is what made him good at what he did. However, I think that not only is Moffat a much better writer than RTD but he also a better showrunner. During the RTD era there were many high points and great episodes (Dalek, Blink, Midnight, Etc.) but along with those there were some godawful terrible episodes (Slitheen two parter, Daleks in Manhattan two parter, Fear Her, etc.). The difference between these were staggering and you almost didn't know what you were getting from week to week. With Moffat's era there isn't a huge discrepancy from the high points to the low points. The worst of the episodes in Moffats era (Curse of the Black Spot, Night Terrors, etc.) are leaps and bounds better than the worst episodes of the RTD era. I'll even go as far as to say I think that the better episodes of Moffat's era are better than the better episodes of RTD's as well. I'll agree with The_Evil_Within in that RTD is a huge fan of the Deux Ex Machina. I'll also agree that even though I love the direction Moffat has taken the show and think he's doing a great job, I think he's a better writer than a showrunner if I had to pick him to do just one job.

"The destination of a stimulus package worth nearly £39m was agreed as part of the Welsh government's budget deal with the Liberal Democrats. Finance Minister Jane Hutt said it would help ""generate immediate benefits"" for the economy. But Plaid Cymru said it was ""completely inadequate"" and the Conservatives said it should go to council tax payers. Labour and the Lib Dems announced a budget deal on Friday night, ending weeks of negotiations between ministers and opposition parties. With 30 of the assembly's 60 seats, Labour needs the help of at least one other party to approve its spending plans. The £38.9m windfall - to be spent over two years - also formed part of budget discussions. The money is coming down from the Treasury as a result of a council tax freeze in England. A programme to help businesses hire young recruits is among projects receiving funding. The government said an extra £4.9m would create 1,800 more apprenticeships. Some £9m will go towards upgrading school buildings, with the same amount spent on delivering an additional 130 homes. The government will spend £3.5 improving roads in places where it is planning to create enterprise zones. Five parts of Wales have been earmarked as zones where businesses will get help to grow. First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that copying the UK government by using the money to keep down council tax would not significantly benefit the economy, adding that tax bills for band D homes were lower on average in Wales. Labour has faced criticism from opponents, particularly Plaid Cymru, for not doing enough to respond to a deteriorating economic situation. Ms Hutt pointed to other government spending commitments, intended to help growth. She said she had considered proposals to spend the money from across the government. She said: ""This package builds on those actions to boost the economy and develop public services, generating immediate benefits for our economy while complementing our long term aims."" Conservative shadow finance minister Paul Davies said he was disappointed ministers were using additional resources to ""top up"" existing policies. He said: ""There is nothing new in this package other than a fresh attempt by Welsh Labour ministers to be seen to act on the economy, while spending money which would be better spent by taxpayers themselves.""

(2) According to the reports from the Member States pursuant to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001, the sum of the reference quantities thus determined for 2004 is 2197147,342 tonnes for all traditional operators A/B and 630713,105 tonnes for all traditional operators C. As these amounts are below the quantities available under the tariff quotas, applying Article 5(3) of the said Regulation would entail the fixing of an adjustment coefficient which would increase the reference quantities for traditional operators. (3) Traditional operators could be allocated an exceptionally small quantity owing to the extreme hardship affecting their activity during the reference year. In accordance with Article 5(5) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001, the Commission may take appropriate measures which are justified for tackling specific situations within the limits of tariff quotas A/B and C. Furthermore, the notification by certain Member States of the sum of the reference quantities established for traditional operators in accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 could be adjusted on completion of the legal proceedings now in hand. (4) Until those situations have progressed, and in order to enable, as appropriate, the necessary measures to be taken regarding the operators concerned, it is advisable, for the time being, not to fix adjustment coefficients to be applied, for 2004, to the reference quantity for each traditional operator. (5) A derogation from Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 should therefore be made. (6) In order that operators have sufficient time to submit licence applications for the first quarter of 2004, this Regulation should enter into force forthwith. (7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 By derogation from Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001, adjustment coefficients to be applied to the reference quantity for traditional operators for tariff quotas A/B and C for 2004 shall not be fixed for the time being.

"""Going for the freeze out"" means basically ignoring her. Giving her space to ""reset"" your relationship and hopefully make her wonder about why she doesn't have your undivided attention anymore. Don't text her, call her or message her. YOU are the prize, if she wants you she will contact you if not then it's her loss. Don't initiate anything with her if she flirts with you flirt back hard , show her the awesome guy she is missing out on and then just walk away. Don't cave in and wildly ask for another date. Your time is too valuable to be on this one chicks beck and call. You are too d@mn busy doing awesome man crap to care. Let her chase you for awhile. After a solid amount of time (varies - and I'm not talking like 2 weeks either.) you can try to re initiate for a possible round 2. I think your best bet would be to ignore her and the oncoming case of oneitis and try to close other chicks, combined with practicing and reading up on how to have good sex. After a few other chicks you are going to forget all about this chick. **TLDR;** 1.)Ignore her, don't initiate contact. 2.)If she initiates flirting, flirt back hard.

"Network Rail and Thames Water engineers are at the scene after the hole appeared in Forest Hill on Monday. The disruption is expected to last until Wednesday, with Southern, Thameslink and London Overground services affected. Thames Water said a sewer under the track had collapsed. It said the repair work was ""extremely complex"" and that engineers had located the problem section of the sewer and were working to seal it. Dry concrete has been put into the hole, forming a base to pour wet concrete on top. Once it has set, about 50 tonnes of ballast will be inserted, with the aim of opening the railway on Wednesday. Network Rail has closed all four lines between East Croydon and London Bridge, meaning Southern services to London Bridge are either cancelled or diverted. London Overground services are not running between West Croydon/Crystal Palace and New Cross Gate. Carl Leadbetter, Thames Water's regional network manager, said: ""Our teams continue to work as fast as possible on this critical job. ""While we need to work quickly to reopen the train lines, we also need to consider local residents, who will potentially suffer from sewer flooding if the pipe is not properly enclosed. ""This is an extremely complex job as the pipe is in a difficult location in the tracks and six metres below the ground."" Network Rail apologised for the delays and said it was working ""as hard as possible"" to get the problem fixed by Wednesday morning's rush hour. Spokesman Chris Denham said the hole ""couldn't be in a worse place"". ""This is a massive piece of railway,"" he told BBC Radio London. ""It's the equivalent of shutting the A2 out of London in the morning. It's absolutely huge."" Some passengers expressed their frustration on social media, mentioning how the problem occurred on the hottest day of the year so far. Elsewhere in London, high temperatures have been disrupting trains between the city and the West, with speeds being cut over fears of rails buckling. Trains coming out of Paddington, Euston and Liverpool Street all saw severe disruption. And Southern services heading to Brighton from Victoria were heavily disrupted following a track failure in the Gatwick area. It comes as commuters have experienced months of cancellations and delays on Southern trains due to an RMT dispute.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Vice President Dick Cheney will serve as acting president briefly Saturday while President Bush is anesthetized for a routine colonoscopy, White House spokesman Tony Snow said Friday. Bush is scheduled to have the medical procedure, expected to take about 2 1/2 hours, at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, Snow said. Bush's last colonoscopy was in June 2002, and no abnormalities were found, Snow said. The president's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. The procedure will be supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, Snow said. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous, according to the Mayo Clinic. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure. Snow said that was the case when Bush had colonoscopies before becoming president. Snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver. Snow told reporters he had a chemo session scheduled later Friday. Watch Snow talk about Bush's procedure and his own colon cancer » . ""The president wants to encourage everybody to use surveillance,"" Snow said.

"COMMISSION DECISION of 27 March 2006 amending Annex II to Council Decision 79/542/EEC as regards regionalisation for Argentina and the model certificates relating to the importation of bovine fresh meat from Brazil (notified under document number C(2006) 896) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/259/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1), and in particular points (1) and (4) of Article 8 and Article 9(4) thereof, Whereas: (1) Council Decision 79/542/EEC of 21 December 1976 drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat (2) provides that imports of those animals and meat are to meet the requirements set out in the appropriate model certificates drawn up under that Decision. (2) Argentina has confirmed an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (type O) in the Province of Corrientes in the Department of San Luís del Palmar and has immediately informed the Commission on 8 February 2006. (3) It is necessary, in order to protect the health status of the Community, to take regionalisation measures temporarily suspending imports of de-boned meat coming from bovines originating from that Department and the surrounding Departments of Berón de Astrada, Capital, General Paz, Empedrado, Itati, Mbucuruyá and San Cosme. (4) The first notification of a suspicion of foot and mouth disease to the Argentinean veterinary authorities was on 4 February 2006. However, the veterinary authorities have suspended certification of exports of meat from animals slaughtered after the 4 January 2006. Consignments of such meat from bovines slaughtered on or after 4 January 2006 from those Departments should be suspended. However by way of derogation from that suspension consignments with a certification signed between 4 January to 4 February 2006 for de-boned and matured meat from bovines slaughtered during the period from 4 January 2006 to 4 February 2006 and already dispatched to the Community should be permitted to be imported into the Community. (5) Following a recent Commission mission to Brazil it appears that although the traceability systems have been substantially improved, some further improvements are necessary in order to avoid possible contacts between animals of different status. It is also necessary to improve the efficacy of foot and mouth disease vaccination and the ability to demonstrate lack of circulation of foot and mouth disease virus taking into account that only de-boned and matured bovine meat is imported into the Community. (6) It is appropriate as an additional measure to provide for supplementary guarantees concerning animal contacts, vaccination and surveillance. (7) Account needs to be taken of the non-vaccination foot and mouth policy in the State of Santa Catarina. (8) Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly. (9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 The Annex to Decision 79/542/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision: Article 2 This Decision shall apply from 31 March 2006.

"COMMISSION DECISION of 4 July 1990 on loans granted by the Belgian authorities to two shipowners for the purchase of a 34 000 m3 LPG ship and two refrigerator ships (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic) (90/627/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof, Having regard to Council Directive 87/167/EEC of 26 January 1987 on aid to shipbuilding (1), and in particular Articles 3 and 4 (1), in conjunction with Article 4 (4) thereof, Having given notice to the parties concerned in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) and having regard to their comments, Whereas: I As a result of information provided by an association of shipbuilders, the Commission's departments learned that the Boelwerf shipyard received orders for a 34 000 m3 LPG ship for Fertex, a shipping company, and for two refrigerator ships for another shipping company, Europese Transport Maatschappij Crystal Prince. An 18-year loan at 2 % interest with a three-year grace period was granted under the Law of 23 August 1948 on shipping credit in respect of 85 % of the contract price in each case. In the first case, by letters dated 6 May 1989, the Commission asked the Belgian authorities to confirm the information. The Belgian authorities replied by letter dated 5 June 1989 that the contract was covered by financing repayable over 15 years, starting three years after the delivery of the ship, without specifying the interest rate, and they stated that in any case the terms of the loan were in line with Directive 87/167/EEC. In addition, the Belgian authorities reminded the Commission of a memorandum sent previously in which they stressed that shipping credit was directed at two objectives, i. e. shipbuilding on the one hand and the high operating costs of ships flying the Belgian flag on the other. Lastly, they stated that they could not follow the Commission departments' calculation of the grant equivalent specified in the Commission's letter of 27 February 1989 terminating Article 93 (2) proceedings in respect of certain measures relating to the shipping sector in Belgium. Although incomplete, the information was deemed sufficient by the Commission to justify the initiation, on 25 October 1989, of proceedings under Article 93 (2). By letter dated 30 November 1989, the Commission informed the Belgian Government accordingly, inviting it to submit its comments, and the other Member States and parties concerned were informed by means of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2). In the second case, the Belgian Government replied by letter dated 17 November 1989, confirming that the loan relating to the two ships covered 85 % of the price and was for 15 years at a 2 % interest rate, and that repayment was to commence only 36 months after the date of delivery. The Commission consequently initiated the procedure laid down in Article 93 (2) on 10 January 1990 and informed the Belgian Government accordingly by letter dated 3 April 1990. The other Member States and other parties concerned were informed by means of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3). II In letters dated 6 February and 15 May 1990, in which it submitted its comments in response to the initiation of proceedings, the Belgian Government began by arguing that the contracts had been signed when the Belgian aid system had just been placed under the authority of the Executive of the Flemish Region and that the latter had merely been applying the rules on the granting of loans in the same way as when the system was administered by the national authorities. It went on to reiterate that the Belgian scheme was made up solely of facilities granted to shipowners in the form of the advance of funds at a reduced interest rate, the provision of a guarantee and an interest rate subsidy, that the combined application of these measures involved the simultaneous granting of production aid and operating aid and that a memorandum setting out this interpretation had already been sent to the Commission when the aid scheme was examined in the light of Directive 87/167/EEC. Since the Belgian Government granted interest rate subsidies on loans entered into by Belgian shipowners for the purchase of ships in third countries, it took the view that this involved only aid for the operation of ships and that accordingly this part of the aid scheme established under the Law of 23 August 1948, where applied to contracts for ships built in Belgium, should not be included in the ceiling laid down in Article 4 (1) of Directive 87/167/EEC. It concluded its argument by stating that the Flemish Executive had acted in good faith on the basis of an approach deriving from a misunderstanding which had arisen in the past between the Belgian Central Government and the Commission. III The Belgian aid scheme falling under Articles 3 and 4 of Directive 87/167/EEC, as notified to the Commission by letter dated 15 January 1988, is governed by the Law of 23 August 1948, as amended on several occasions and most recently on 30 December 1980, and is intended to ensure the maintenance and development of the merchant fleet and sea fishing and for this purpose sets up a fund for shipping and shipbuilding. Article 1 (a) of the Law provides that the fund may grant advances covering up to 70 % of the value of a new ship. Article 1 (b) provides for a State guarantee in respect of supplementary loans contracted at market rates, and Article 1 (c) grants an interest subsidy amounting to half of the interest rate on such loans, but not exceeding 3 %. However, the total amount of the advances and loans provided for in Article 1 (a) and (c) may not exceed 85 % of the price of the ship. The Law does not, however, stipulate at what rate or over what period the advance provided for in Article 1 (a) must be repaid. During the preparatory work on Directive 87/167/EEC, the Belgian Government informed the Commission of the rules for repayment of advances granted under Article 1 (a) of the Law of 23 August 1948, stating that such advances covered a 15-year period. With a two-year grace period, and an interest rate of 4 to 5 %. These terms confirmed by the Belgian Government by letter dated 21 March 1988 within the framework of the examination of all shipbuilding aid in Belgium under Article 10 of Directive 87/167/EEC. IV On the basis of the terms for granting advances, guarantees and interest subsidies as notified to the Commission, and taking account of a market interest rate which at the time the contracts were concluded was 8,25 % in respect of the 34 000 m3 LPG ship and the refrigerator ships, the grant equivalent of the advances granted by the Belgian Government under the Law of 23 August 1948, the calculation of which was duly explained to its authorities, should have been 20,5 %. V The contracts in question were in fact accompanied by loans equivalent to 85 % of the price of the ship at a 2 % interest rate for a term of 15 years, with repayment starting only 36 months after the delivery of the ship. These terms mean that the loans granted by the Belgian Government are equivalent to 35 %. VI Since responsibility for administration of the fund set up under the Belgian Law of 23 August 1948 has devolved to the Executive of the Flemish Region, the latter body was responsible for the decisions taken as from 1 January 1989 in accordance with the amendments made to the Belgian Constitution in 1988. This transfer of responsibility does not, however, excuse the Belgian Government or allow it to argue that the Executive of the Flemish Region was simply acting in good faith in maintaining continuity in the application of the aid scheme, since Article 5 of the Treaty stipulates clearly that Member States shall take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaty or resulting from action taken by the institutions of the Community. Nor does the fact that the Belgian Government sent the Commission a memorandum stating that the Belgian aid scheme was partly intended to support shipyards and partly to support the operation of sea transport under the Belgian flag provide any justification for the terms of the loan granted. The arguments set out in the memorandum merely reiterated the points which had been thoroughly discussed with the experts of the Member States during the preparatory work on Directive 81/363/EEC (4), and it was advisedly, in order to ensure full transparency, that the Council of Ministers, with the backing of the Belgian Government, finally decided in adopting Directive 87/167/EEC to include all aid to shipowners, where such aid is linked to the purchase of a ship in the Member States, in the ceiling provided for in Article 4 (1). It was therefore in full knowledge of the facts that the Belgian Government granted the loan in the case in point, and the fact of granting aid to shipowners in respect of ships built in third countries, under whatever pretext, does not in any way justify the grant equivalent of such aid being deducted where aid is granted in respect of ships built in Belgium. VII The aid granted to shipowners in Belgium is aid within the meaning of Article 3 (1) and (2) of Directive 87/167/EEC, which stipulates that all forms of aid to shipowners or to third parties actually used for the building or conversion of ships in Community shipyards (including credit facilities, guarantees and tax concessions) is subject in full to the rules set out in Article 4 of the Directive. Article 4 (1) states that production aid in favour of shipbuilding may be considered compatible with the common market provided that the total amount of aid granted in support of any individual contract does not exceed, in grant equivalent, a common maximum ceiling which, as stipulated in Article 4 (2), is fixed by the Commission. Article 4 (4) further stipulates that the ceiling applies to aid falling within Article 3 (2). Since the ceiling was fixed for 1989 at 26 % and since the loan granted by the Belgian Government amounts to a grant equivalent of 35 %, it is clear that the Belgian Government has not complied with the rules laid down in Directive 87/167/EEC and hence with the rules laid down in the Treaty, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 The loans having a grant equivalent of 35 % granted by the Belgian Government to the shipping companies Fertex and Europese Transport Maatschappij Crystal Prince for the building, respectively, of a 35 000 m3 LPG ship and two refrigerator ships in the Boelwerf shipyard are incompatible with the common market. Article 2 Pursuant to Article 93 (2) of the Treaty, the Belgian Government shall revise the terms of the loans so as to reduce them to a maximum level of 26 % in grant equivalent terms, in line with the ceiling fixed by the Commission for 1989 in accordance with Article 4 (2) of Directive 87/167/EEC. Article 3 The Belgian Government shall inform the Commission of the measures which it has taken in order to comply with this Decision within two months of being notified of it. Article 4 This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium. Done at Brussels, 4 July 1990.",formal

"A number of options are being considered to improve care in the north of the county, including removing consultant-led services from Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital.

They have warned mothers and babies ""may die"" if consultant-led maternity services are removed from Whitehaven and concentrated at Carlisle Cumberland Infirmary. Trust chief executive Stephen Eames told BBC Cumbria: ""The options we are looking at are likely to mean there will be changes in maternity services and they're likely to mean we'll need to concentrate our expertise in our consultant staff in one place.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The women are too afraid and ashamed to show their faces or have their real names used. They have been driven to sell their bodies to put food on the table for their children -- for as little as $8 a day. Suha, 37, is a mother of three. She says her husband thinks she is cleaning houses when she leaves home. ""People shouldn't criticize women, or talk badly about them,"" says 37-year-old Suha as she adjusts the light colored scarf she wears these days to avoid extremists who insist women cover themselves. ""They all say we have lost our way, but they never ask why we had to take this path."" A mother of three, she wears light makeup, a gold pendant of Iraq around her neck, and an unexpected air of elegance about her. ""I don't have money to take my kid to the doctor. I have to do anything that I can to preserve my child, because I am a mother,"" she says, explaining why she prostitutes herself. Anger and frustration rise in her voice as she speaks. ""No matter what else I may be, no matter how off the path I may be, I am a mother!"" Watch a woman describe turning to prostitution to ""save my child"" » . Her clasped hands clench and unclench nervously. Suha's husband thinks that she is cleaning houses when she goes away. So does Karima's family. ""At the start I was cleaning homes, but I wasn't making much. No matter how hard I worked it just wasn't enough,"" she says. Karima, clad in all black, adds, ""My husband died of lung cancer nine months ago and left me with nothing."" She has five children, ages 8 to 17. Her eldest son could work, but she's too afraid for his life to let him go into the streets, preferring to sacrifice herself than risk her child. She was solicited the first time when she was cleaning an office. ""They took advantage of me,"" she says softly. ""At first I rejected it, but then I realized I have to do it."" Both Suha and Karima have clients that call them a couple times a week. Other women resort to trips to the market to find potential clients. Or they flag down vehicles. Prostitution is a choice more and more Iraqi women are making just to survive. ""It's increasing,"" Suha says. ""I found this 'thing' through my friend, and I have another friend in the same predicament as mine. Because of the circumstance, she is forced to do such things."" Violence, increased cost of living, and lack of any sort of government aid leave women like these with few other options, according to humanitarian workers. ""At this point there is a population of women who have to sell their bodies in order to keep their children alive,"" says Yanar Mohammed, head and founder of the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq. ""It's a taboo that no one is speaking about."" She adds, ""There is a huge population of women who were the victims of war who had to sell their bodies, their souls and they lost it all. It crushes us to see them, but we have to work on it and that's why we started our team of women activists."" Her team pounds the streets of Baghdad looking for these victims often too humiliated to come forward. ""Most of the women that we find at hospitals [who] have tried to commit suicide"" have been involved in prostitution, said Basma Rahim, a member of Mohammed's team. The team's aim is to compile information on specific cases and present it to Iraq's political parties -- to have them, as Mohammed puts it, ""come tell us what [they] are ... going to do about this."" Rahim tells the heartbreaking story of one woman they found who lives in a room with three of her children: ""She has sex while her three children are in the room, but she makes them stand in separate corners."" According to Rahim and Mohammed, most of the women they encounter say they are driven to prostitution by a desperate desire for survival in the dangerously violent and unforgiving circumstances in Iraq. ""They took this path but they are not pleased,"" Rahim says. Karima says when she sees her children with food on the table, she is able to convince herself that it's worth it. ""Everything is for the children. They are the beauty in life and, without them, we cannot live."" But she says, ""I would never allow my daughter to do this. I would rather marry her off at 13 than have her go through this."" Karima's last happy memory is of her late husband, when they were a family and able to shoulder the hardships of life in today's Iraq together. Suha says as a young girl she dreamed of being a doctor, with her mom boasting about her potential in that career. Life couldn't have taken her further from that dream. ""It's not like we were born into this, nor was it ever in my blood,"" she says. What she does for her family to survive now eats away at her. ""I lay on my pillow and my brain is spinning, and it all comes back to me as if I am watching a movie."" E-mail to a friend .",formal

"The 32-year-old attacking midfielder has signed a two-year deal with Hull City after eight months Stateside. ""The national team weighed heavily on my mind,"" said Maloney. ""It was in March that I noticed that the travel back for the international games was proving more difficult than I thought it was going to be."" The former Celtic, Aston Villa and Wigan player acknowledged ""it was proving difficult"" to be ""physically 100% able for training and matches"" as he looked to add to his 40 international caps. Maloney played in both of Scotland's matches in the spring, where he was subbed at half-time in the friendly against Northern Ireland and played the full 90 minutes of the 6-1 win over Gibraltar in Euro 2016 Group D qualifying. In June, he was back in Scotland for the friendly against Qatar and a few days later played a key role in Scotland's 1-1 draw in the Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. Earlier this week, he was named in the Scotland squad for next month's Euro qualifiers against Georgia in Tbilisi and Germany at Hampden. He said of his decision to leave Chicago: ""There were various reasons, a couple of them personal, but once I thought about it professionally, I still had a real desire to achieve something in British football. ""I have loved living in Chicago. I had a brilliant time. I don't think I've been happier living anywhere else. ""The football didn't work out they way we all hoped. The owner, the manager hoped for things to be different. ""I didn't want to give the national manager any excuse whenever I met up with the national team, travelling back from Chicago."" Maloney did not speak to Scotland boss Gordon Strachan about his move to Hull, a Championship club he was keen to join with Steve Bruce as manager. He said: ""Once I made it known that I was going to come back, it was two or three weeks ago that Hull showed an interest in me. That's when a decision had to be made. ""My mind was made up pretty quickly that I wanted to play for him. Everything is geared up to get the team back into the Premier League."" Scotland sit third behind Poland and Germany in Group D qualifying. ""We're in a good position,"" Maloney added. ""Let's hope that we're good enough to get the results needed to get us out the group and get us to a major championship.""",formal

"I've found that low-class mobs, Centurions and Marauders most notably, seem to stagger consistently when they're in the radius of the Singularity. The chip damage and the stagger provides time enough for me to get shots off with the Hurricane. This tactic is sufficient enough for me to deal with general enemies. But I agree to a point. The Singularity-Adept really can't bank on priming and detonating their own explosions. They *can* self-detonate, but it requires the player to operate within a terrifying and narrow margin of error. As a duder who isn't very good at video games, that's probably not a square deal. I love the new Singularity Adept much in the same way I like the Paladin. I'm now a de facto shield stripper. 200+ damage p/second isn't monumental on Gold, but that chip damage plus the overwhelming assault from a Hurricane slotted with Disruptor Ammo helps the Adept soften the front lines up. Shockwave can stagger pretty much everything, and Warp is there to really hurt the armored guys. Maybe I'm in the minority on this, but I always found the Human Adept to be dependent on other strong power users.

"Prosecutors accuse Fifa president Sepp Blatter of making a ""disloyal payment"" of $2m (Â£1.6m) to Mr Platini. Mr Platini has provided information to the investigation but said he did so as a witness. Both men deny any wrongdoing. Mr Platini has said he is still determined to run for Fifa president once Mr Blatter steps down. Asked whether criminal proceedings had been opened against him, Mr Platini said: ""Absolutely not. I was heard last week by the Swiss Authorities only as a person providing information and I cooperated fully."" But this was contradicted by the Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, who said: ""We didn't interview Mr Platini as a witness, that's not true. We investigated against him in between as a witness and an accused person."" Mr Lauber also said he was prepared to search the Uefa headquarters as part of the investigation. The allegations centre on a payment made to Mr Platini in 2011 at Fifa's expense for work he completed almost a decade earlier. It came just two months before Uefa gave its backing to Blatter's 2011 presidential campaign, leading some to question the timing of it. Mr Platini said he was told when starting the work that Fifa would not be able to pay him all the money because of its ""financial situation"". But Fifa accounts show a revenue surplus of around $83m (Â£55m) from 1999-2002, when Mr Platini undertook the work as a technical adviser. Fifa was thrown into turmoil this year when the US and Swiss authorities launched separate investigations into corruption at the body. Mr Blatter is also suspected of signing a contract that was ""unfavourable to Fifa"". He is due to stand down next year, but says he will carry on in the role despite the criminal proceedings.",formal

whereas, pursuant to the criteria referred to in the said paragraph, the maximum quantity for each of the 1991/92, 1992/93 and 1993/94 marketing years should be kept as set out below; Whereas, as a result of the application of Articles 68 and 236 of the Act of Accession, the intervention price for olive oil in Spain and Portugal differs from the common prices; whereas, after the adjustment of the 'acquis communautaire' with relation to vegetable oils and fats, the detailed rules for the alignment of intervention prices for olive oil applicable in Spain and Portugal are those set out in the second indents of Articles 92 (2) and 290 (2) of the Act of Accession;

"I have one very distinct memory of bad saves. In Final Fantasy Tactics, there's a boss encounter about 3/4ths of the way through the game that you have to fight with only your main character. It's at the end of a series of battles, meaning you can't move through the world map between them. The first time I ever played the game I got stuck here, I hadn't been staggering my saves, and saved over my only slot right after the first battle. I wasn't strong enough to defeat the boss and got stuck. I ended up having to restart from the beginning to beat him. Fast forward to Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions on the PSP. I was well aware of the boss, but I wasn't sure where. I had staggered saves and I was making sure that I always had a backup save. Somehow when it came time to fight that boss again, I had messed up my staggered saves and gotten stuck again. I think there was a cutscene or something before the first battle that you could save at, I don't quite remember exactly how I messed it up. I could go back to the battle before but that didn't help too much. Stuck yet again, I gave up. Luckily I aced it when I played through the game again on the iPhone. The best manual way to deal with it is to stagger saves over several slots, giving you X number of saves back from your current save. Ideally though you shouldn't have to think about it at all in a well-designed system. I wouldn't call your Dark Souls or FF issues related to bad saves. Those are both just part of the game that you have to deal with. A real bad save is one where you are stuck losing regardless of what you do. **TLDR: Fuck Wiegraf**",informal

(2) Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that, where the receipts expected from the basic production levy and the B levy, which must not exceed 2 % and 30 % respectively of the intervention price for white sugar for that marketing year, may well fail to cover the foreseeable total loss for the current marketing year, the maximum percentage of the B levy is to be adjusted to the extent necessary to cover the said total loss but without exceeding 37,5 %. (3) The foreseeable receipts, before adjustment, of the levies to be collected in respect of the 2002/03 marketing year are likely to be below the equivalent of the average loss multiplied by the exportable surplus. Therefore, in the light of the data at present available, the maximum amount of the B levy for 2002/03 should be raised to 37,5 % of the intervention price for the white sugar concerned. (4) Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that, subject to Article 15(5) of that Regulation, the minimum price for B beet is fixed at EUR 32,42 per tonne. Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the revised maximum percentage for the B levy should be fixed for the current marketing year before 15 September of the marketing year, together with the corresponding adjustment of the minimum price for B beet set for the 2002/03 marketing year by Article 4(1)(b) of that Regulation. (5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 For the 2002/03 marketing year, the maximum amount of the B levy referred to in the first indent of Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 shall be increased to 37,5 % of the intervention price for white sugar.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination Sunday to blistering criticism of the Iraq war from former coalition commander retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez. Lawmakers lashed back at retired Gen. Ricardo Sanchez on Sunday after he criticized the war effort. On Friday, Sanchez, who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004, called the Iraq war ""a nightmare with no end in sight."" He said the Bush administration, the State Department and Congress all share blame. Speaking with military reporters in Virginia, Sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not been held accountable. ""I'm astounded, really,"" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on CNN's ""Late Edition"" with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday. Graham, who recently returned from Baghdad, said he and GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain had visited Sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004. ""Every time we talked to Gen. Sanchez, we got pushback -- we have enough troops; Guard and reserves aren't being strained,"" Graham said. He added that Sanchez's own record in Iraq is blemished: Abu Ghraib ""got out of control under his watch. The war in general got out of control under his watch."" But Graham said that ""finally,"" with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops since January, ""We are getting it right."" Sanchez told reporters that American political leaders have cost American lives on the battlefield with their ""lust for power."" Sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty, but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired. ""While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power, our soldiers die,"" he said. That brought a tart response from McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time,"" McCain told CBS's ""Face the Nation."" He said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but ""unfortunately, that doesn't happen very often."" One of the reasons few speak out, he said, is evidenced by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki, McCain said. Shinseki was sidelined after telling Congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Iraq. Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told ABC's ""This Week"" that Sanchez is simply wrong. ""My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror,"" he said. ""I think we're making significant progress toward that end."" But, he added, ""I think the central government in Iraq has been an embarrassment. They've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for."" Graham said he hopes the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will ""step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year."" If that does not happen, he said, ""it will be incumbent upon us, as a nation, to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable Iraq."" That brought a blistering response from Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Carter. ""What is this? This is a colony,"" he said. ""That's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter."" Even those Iraqis who were happy to see Saddam Hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing U.S. presence, Brzezinski said. Though some countries are willing to go along with the United States, ""No one in the world really supports our policy in Iraq,"" he said. In his Friday speech, Sanchez added that the ""surge"" of U.S. troops into Iraq represents ""a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war."" National Security Council spokeswoman Kate Starr did not address the comment. Instead, she said, ""We appreciate his service to the country. As Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker said, there's more work to be done but progress is being made in Iraq. And that's what we're focused on now."" Gen. David Petraeus is the U.S. top commander in Iraq.

"(CNN) -- China has suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys contaminated with a chemical that can convert to a powerful ""date rape"" drug, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Saturday. The toys have caused some children who swallowed the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness. China suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys that contain a chemical that converts into a ""date rape"" drug. The agency said that the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) has ordered an investigation by quality control agencies and will release results as soon as they are available. The AQSIQ did not reveal the name of the toys' producer, Xinhua said. U.S. safety officials voluntarily recalled about 4.2 million of the Chinese-made toys Wednesday. Scientists have found the highly popular holiday toy contains a chemical that, once metabolized, converts into the toxic ""date rape"" drug GHB (gamma-hydroxy butyrate), Scott Wolfson, a spokesman with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), told CNN. ""Children who swallow the beads can become comatose, develop respiratory depression or have seizures,"" a CPSC statement warned. The arts-and-craft beads, which have been selling since April at major U.S. retail stores under the name ""Aqua Dots,"" have also been distributed in Australia under the name ""Bindeez Beads."" The Bindeez toys were recalled Tuesday by Melbourne-based Moose Enterprise Pty. Ltd. after three children in Australia swallowed large quantities of the beads and were hospitalized. ""I was so frightened because I thought she wasn't going to make it,"" Heather Lehane told CNN affiliate Network 7 of her 10-year-old daughter, Charlotte, who was hospitalized in Australia after ingesting some of the beads. In the United States, the Washington-based safety commission said it has in recent days received two reports detailing the severe effects of the digested beads, which are part of a craft kit aimed at kids 4 years and older. The CPSC said a boy nearly 2 years old ""swallowed several dozen beads. He became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state for a period of time."" The commission said the toddler was hospitalized and has since ""fully recovered."" The second incident involved a child who vomited, fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days. It was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery. Toronto-based toy distributor Spin Master Ltd. stopped shipping the Aqua Dots toys and asked retailers to pull them off their shelves, where they were previously sold for $17 to $30. Anyone with Aqua Dots at home should return the product to the company, CPSC spokeswoman Julie Vallese said. The toy had been named toy of the year in Australia and recently crested Wal-Mart's list of top 12 Christmas toys. Wal-Mart on Thursday listed the toys on its Web site as ""out of stock online"" and had removed them from their top toy list as well. This latest recall is part of a larger batch of recalls of Chinese-made toys that have swept across the country. Last month alone, U.S. government safety officials and retailers voluntarily recalled at least 69,000 Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint, which can cause hazardous lead poisoning.

"Since this is a rather specific subreddit and close to home I'm gonna have to cut short on the details. It was on a high adventure. We had one kid who had been problematic for years, he was in my patrol for a couple years and it was a nightmare. His personality is impossible to describe; sometimes he's hilarious, others obnoxious, and occasionally just insane. there are various things that got him into trouble on this trip, I'll just list a few. He spent half the trip naked, which any adult leader would know is a youth protection nightmare, but when you're 60+ miles from the nearest phone, vehicle, or access to the outside world, there's nothing the leaders can do about it when this kid has the attitude of the joker. He has no fear of consequences whatsoever whether it's losing brownie points or even legal consequences. He's extremely intelligent, very athletic, and a black belt in some form of kicking people's asses (I've seen him take on people much larger than him in person) and about 16 years old so there isn't much our victim (scrawny adult with the build of a 14 year old girl) could do at all to stop this kid. when the leader was away from the campsite, the kid ran into the tent naked and got in the leader's sleeping bag. on other occasions he would sexually harass the leader and even try dry humping him in front of everyone and thought it was funny. the leader tolerated this for the sake of the kids who had behaved themselves and wanted to finish the trip but he drew the line when he overheard our psycho trying to pressure another boy into comparing penises. Needless to say this kid was immediately kicked out of the troop and it pretty much destroyed us. we had an awesome troop with some amazing adult leaders that I still consider some of my greatest role models today. After these events, some of the best leaders we had left the troop for various reasons. the troop is now falling apart because of this crazy kid. We were unique in a good way. we followed our own moral compass which is why i thought we were much better than the standard boy scout troop. We encouraged people to challenge the rules when necessary (think outside the box and come up with our own way of solving problems) and the BSA hated us. It was wonderful. that's all gone now and it's just like a standard follow the book troop. And that's how crazy kid ruined Christmas! (sorry if i seemed like i was rambling at the end, i get worked up when talking about this) TL;DR: crazy 16 year old kid with the mindset of the Joker spends entire trip naked and humps leader. the entire troop crumbles. EDIT: in case you're interested, I've got some less depressing stories of kids getting booted from our troop. 1. kid shoved frog up his ass at summer camp. (11 years old) 2. Kid tried to lead a mutiny on me at summer camp, attempted to beat me up (I believe I was 15 at the time and he was 11)",informal

"SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Favorable weather and firefighter reinforcements helped ease the fire danger in parts of Southern California Thursday, but the human toll from the disaster was still coming to light. A firefighter watches the Harris Fire. Four bodies were found in a canyon in the path of the blaze Thursday. The number of deaths attributed directly to the fires grew to seven Thursday, after the charred bodies of four people believed to be illegal immigrants were found in a canyon east of San Diego. Seven other deaths are labeled as fire-related: Three elderly people died during evacuations, and four others died after being evacuated. Improving conditions allowed more people to come home Thursday, but new evacuations were ordered in areas where the unrelenting flames marched on. Where residents could return, they often found ash and rubble in place of their homes. ""We see pictures from online and on TV, but it's just, it's much different when you see it up front,"" said Louela Binlac in front of what remained of her Rancho Bernardo home. ""The most important thing is that our family is still together, everybody is safe, and eventually we will rebuild again,"" she said. ""Those things you can replace. We are just all grateful that everybody is safe."" Rancho Bernardo resident Marilyn Wood said it was ""really scary"" to come back to the pile of ashes she once called home. Her voice breaking, Wood vowed to rebuild and recounted how she and her husband, Gordon, fled early Monday with only minutes to spare. See photos of the fires » .

Almost 9,000 firefighters battled the blazes, augmented by reinforcements from dozens of states across the country.

Along with homes and businesses, the flames have destroyed roughly one-third of San Diego County's lucrative avocado crop, along with other croplands, greenhouses and nurseries. A change in the winds -- from a ferocious 100 mph on Sunday to an almost manageable 10 mph on Thursday -- brought welcome relief and allowed a full-bore aerial assault on the fires. Reinforcements from across the country arrived to aid the exhausted firefighters, officials said. While the fires still threatened some 25,000 homes, the burn rate in the region -- a measure made up of factors like wind speed, humidity and available fuel -- was significantly lower Thursday, a spokeswoman at the California Department of Forestry and Protection said. Residents of several communities, including the city of San Diego, were allowed to return home Wednesday and Thursday, but more evacuations were ordered -- the latest covering the communities of Lake Henshaw and Mesa Grande and the La Jolla Indian Reservation in San Diego County. With the shifting fires, some shelters closed as others opened closer to danger. In San Diego, Mayor Jerry Sanders announced that Qualcomm Stadium -- the home of NFL's Chargers that held 11,000 evacuees at the height of the fires but dropped to 750 Wednesday night -- would close to evacuees. ""As we transition from a large-scale emergency evacuation center into the recovery process, we have begun assisting all evacuees to find more suitable shelter and housing,"" Sanders said. ""Toward that end, Qualcomm will close as an emergency shelter at noon tomorrow [Friday].""

"Mr Varoufakis said Greece was subject to a programme that will ""go down in history as the greatest disaster of macroeconomic management ever"". The German parliament approved the opening of negotiations on Friday. The bailout could total €86bn (£60bn) in exchange for austerity measures. In a damning assessment, Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's Mark Lobel: ""This programme is going to fail whoever undertakes its implementation."" Asked how long that would take, he replied: ""It has failed already."" Mr Varoufakis resigned earlier this month, in what was widely seen as a conciliatory gesture towards the eurozone finance ministers with whom he had clashed frequently. He said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has admitted that he does not believe in the bailout, had little option but to sign. ""We were given a choice between being executed and capitulating. And he decided that capitulation was the optimal strategy."" Mr Tsipras has announced a cabinet reshuffle, sacking several ministers who voted against the reforms in parliament this week. But he opted not to bring in technocrats or opposition politicians as replacements. As a result, our correspondent says, Mr Tsipras will preside over ministers who, like himself, harbour serious doubts about the reform programme. Greece must pass further reforms on Wednesday next week to secure the bailout. Germany was the last of the eurozone countries needing parliamentary approval to begin the talks. But the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has warned that the process will not be easy, saying he expected the negotiations to take four weeks. On Saturday, the Greek government ordered banks to open on Monday following three weeks of closures. But the decree stated that the weekly withdrawal limit should be a maximum €420. Separately, the European Council approved the €7bn bridging loan for Greece from an EU-wide emergency fund. The loan was approved in principle by eurozone ministers on Thursday and now has the go-ahead from all non-euro states. It means Greece will now be able to repay debts to two of its creditors, the ECB and International Monetary Fund (IMF), due on Monday.",formal

"(CNN) -- Three Palestinians, including two sick children, have died recently while waiting for resettlement from Iraq, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday. UNHCR goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie visits the Al Waleed refugee camp in August. About 2,000 Palestinian refugees are stranded in camps along the Syrian border and face difficult living conditions, including limited medical care, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency has appealed for the resettlement of ""vulnerable and sick"" children in Al Waleed refugee camp at the Iraqi-Syrian border. One of those who died in the camp was a 3-year-old Palestinian boy who was suffering from rickets and pneumonia. He died a few days ago in a Ramadi hospital and then was buried in Al Waleed. The other was a 14-year-old suffering from Hodgkin's disease who died in Baghdad last week. A 50-year-old man who was waiting to be resettled died earlier this month in Al Waleed. The agency says seven people, including three children, have died at the camp since refugees fleeing attackers began arriving at the border in March 2006. About 30 to 40 people arrive at the Al Waleed camp each week, the UNHCR reports. The agency has been pursuing medical resettlement. ""UNHCR has helped resettle one family of eight with several sick children from this camp to Norway last August. Another 11 medical cases submitted for resettlement are awaiting approval,"" the agency said, which is working to identify other medical cases. And it is urging the resettlement of the entire group. ""UNHCR has sought solutions for the whole group since last year and has only received positive indications from Sudan and Chile,"" the agency said. Thousands of Palestinians have lived in Iraq, with some going there when Israel was formed and others born there. The UNHCR notes that some got ""preferential treatment"" under the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. But they have been the targets of violence since he was toppled.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Genarlow Wilson, freed last week from a Georgia prison, said he's glad he rejected a plea deal from prosecutors, even if it would have sprung him from prison months earlier. Genarlow Wilson tells CNN on Sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future. The 21-year-old, who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation, said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal. He had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day, he said Sunday. ""It might've been lesser time, but then again, I would have nowhere to go because I would have no home,"" Wilson said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m. ""I wouldn't be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister. You know, when you're a sex offender you can't be around kids. Basically, I can't even have kids myself, you know, so what is the point of life?"" he asked. In 2005, a jury found Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 New Year's Eve party. Wilson was 17 at the time of the party. Watch Wilson say why he rejected the plea deal » . The conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation. According to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, prosecutors in Douglas County, Georgia, offered Wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence, possibly to time served, and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record. Defense attorney B.J. Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he didn't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence. The state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted, making such sexual encounters misdemeanors. However, the Legislature did not make the law retroactive, so it had no effect on Wilson's sentence. Now 21, Wilson was released Friday after the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the young man's sentence ""constitutes cruel and unusual punishment."" Wilson said Sunday he feels no ""negative energy"" toward District Attorney David McDade, who fought efforts to have Wilson's sentence reduced. Instead, Wilson said, he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies. He wants to major in sociology, he said, ""because I feel like I've been living my major."" The new Genarlow Wilson will be more conservative, more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him, he said. ""When it seems like you have everything, you know, you feel like you have no worries until it's all gone, and I know what it feels like to be without and I don't want to ever feel like that again,"" said the former honor student, football star and homecoming king. ""I don't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison, period."" Though he called his sentence ""absurd,"" Wilson said he understands that prosecutors ""were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law."" Wilson also said he knows what he did was foolish. ""I was young then. I did some idiotic things in my teen years, but you know, every average teen does,"" he said. ""I don't think any of us made very wise decisions, but I don't think that any of us can go back then and change what happened."" E-mail to a friend .",formal

"James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin died when Cheeki Rafiki, the yacht they were sailing, capsized in the North Atlantic. Prosecutors at Winchester Crown Court said yacht manager Douglas Innes failed to get it checked ahead of its trip. Mr Innes, of Stormforce Coaching, denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. The 42-year-old, of Whitworth Crescent, Southampton, also denies a further charge of failing to ensure the vessel was operated in a safe manner. Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC also outlined to the court how the yacht had been given a category 2 code, which meant it was only authorised to be used commercially up to 60 miles away from a ""safe haven"". The code certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy, he added. The men were returning from Antigua Sailing Week to Southampton when the vessel overturned in May 2014. The court heard that after receiving an urgent email from Andrew Bridge on board the yacht, Mr Innes, who was in a pub at the time, did not call the coastguard but instead went to another pub where Mr Bridge phoned saying the situation had worsened. Mr Innes returned home, called the coastguard and emailed the crew suggesting they check the bolts of the keel. Mr Lickley said it was a ""tragedy"" that they would eventually discover a number of bolts had failed or broken, causing the keel to detach from the yacht. He said: ""Some had failed and were broken and had been for some time,"" before the yacht left the UK in October 2013. Skipper Mr Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, Mr Male, 22, from Romsey, Hampshire, Mr Warren, 52, from Bridgwater in Somerset and Mr Goslin, 56, from West Camel in Somerset, died after the yacht lost its keel more than 700 miles from Nova Scotia in Canada. The yacht was found by a container ship on 17 May, two days after Mr Bridge's urgent email, with its life raft still on board. Mr Lickley told jurors the keel's loss would have caused a ""rapid capsize"" and the men on deck would have been ""jettisoned"" into the water while those inside would have been trapped. He added: ""What is clear from two of the emergency beacons used by Andrew Bridge and James Male is that they may have survived for some time, most probably in the water, that is until they were lost too."" The US Coastguard was criticised for calling off its search after two days. However, following protests from family and friends, and intervention by the British government, it was restarted and the boat was discovered, the court heard. The trial continues.",formal

"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN) -- An enraged crowd dragged the body of an Ethiopian soldier through the streets of Somalia's capital Thursday after gun battles with Islamic insurgents killed 19 people, witnesses reported. In a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving Somali militias in which the bodies of U.S. troops were dragged through the streets, crowds Thursday shouted ""God is great"" as they pulled the bruised, bullet-riddled corpse through a dusty Mogadishu neighborhood. The body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic when insurgents pulled it out of a car and left it with the crowd in the northern Mogadishu neighborhood of Suqa Holaha, witnesses reported. Nine Ethiopians are reportedly part of the 19 dead. Another battle broke out on the city's south side Thursday morning between Ethiopian troops and insurgents armed with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes, on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks. ""Ethiopians will launch violent attacks on us, for some of their comrades have been killed today,"" said Rahma Nor Omar, an elderly woman in the capital. ""They will be like wounded animals."" Witnesses put the death toll from the day's clashes at 19, including Ethiopian troops, insurgents and civilians. Ethiopian troops arrived in Somalia in December 2006 to help a weak Somali government drive the Islamic Courts Union out of Mogadishu and restore a U.N.-backed transitional government after a decade and a half of near-anarchy. The Islamists responded by launching an insurgency against Somali government and Ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year. The United States accused the ICU of harboring suspected al Qaeda figures, including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and raised no objections to Ethiopian presence in Somalia. Washington has long been concerned that Somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists, but ICU leaders denied harboring al Qaeda suspects. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"Capped 94 times, Phillips' comments come as criticism has been levelled at coach Rob Howley for failing to bring new players into the Wales team. As they prepare to face France, Wales have capped just three new players since the 2015 World Cup, but Phillips says he understands the situation. ""You can't just blood youngsters because they are young,"" he said. Since 2015, only Blues flanker Ellis Jenkins, Newport Gwent Dragons lock Cory Hill and Ospreys fly-half Sam Davies have been handed their senior debuts. In Wales' final Six Nations clash in Paris, there have been calls for Howley to have one eye on the future and play new faces. Instead the has stuck with the same side that beat Ireland last time out. This comes despite Howley having a host of uncapped players in his squad in the shape of Ospreys flanker Olly Cracknell and lock Rory Thornton, Leicester fly-half Owen Williams, Scarlets wing Steffan Evans, Dragons wing Ashton Hewitt, Scarlets scrum-half Aled Davies and Wasps flanker Thomas Young. Media playback is not supported on this device Howley has also ignored calls for Davies to start at fly-half and for Ospreys' teenager Keelan Giles to come in on the wing. Phillips said he agreed with Howley's decision and that he believed the onus was on the young players to show they are ready for the senior side. ""There's a few guys on the verge, but those youngsters have still got to learn,"" Phillips told BBC Radio Wales. ""They are young and developing, but they will get their time in seasons to come. But they've got to improve in training and show Rob that they deserve to be first-choice players."" Against France, Phillips believes Howley has got his selection spot on. He added: ""It's a difficult one. In that international jersey should be the best because you are the best in the position. You should not just hand out caps willy-nilly to people. ""The development of the future is an important thing, but that needs to be done in a structured way. ""But it has been difficult because of the way things have panned out. They've looked to get the wins and back those players. The best players in Wales are playing on the field, it's as simple as that really.""",formal

"Labour said 160,000 people would lose out as a result of changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIPs). The disability minister said new rules to clarify eligibility criteria for payments would ensure those most in need received maximum support. The action follows two court judgements on how benefits claims are scored. Labour said the government was not listening to criticism of how payments are assessed. The Liberal Democrats said the government was using court losses ""as an excuse to severely restrict disability benefits"". Disability rights campaigners said the changes were one of a number of cuts and changes faced by disabled people and those in ill health. Two tribunal rulings came in late 2016. One found someone who needed support at home to take medication or monitor a health condition like diabetes would score the same on the benefits criteria as people who needed help with a therapy such as kidney dialysis. A second ruling said people who struggled to travel independently because of conditions such as anxiety scored the same as someone who was, for example, blind. The government said the combined effects of the rulings would have added £3.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023. The benefit payments are aimed at helping people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs. The replacement of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which was partly self-assessed, with PIPs, where eligibility is tested by a company, has been controversial. Eligibility for PIPs is reviewed regularly and the qualifying criteria are also stricter. In a written statement to the House of Commons on Thursday, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work Penny Mordaunt said the government monitored how effective the payment was in supporting those facing the greatest barriers to leading independent lives. She said that PIPs were designed to give ""non-physical conditions... the same recognition as physical ones"". But she added: ""Now, over two thirds of PIP claimants with mental health conditions get the higher Daily Living award, worth £82.30 per week, compared to 22% under DLA."" She said amendments to the criteria would ""provide greater clarity"", saying: ""This will not result in any claimants seeing a reduction in the amount of PIP previously awarded by DWP (the Department of Work and Pensions)."" But Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, said: ""Instead of listening to the court's criticisms of Personal Independence Payment assessments and correcting these injustices, the government has instead decided to undermine the legal basis of the rulings."" It was an ""unprecedented attempt"" to subvert a tribunal judgement, she said. She said Labour would fight changes to ""strip"" entitlements from more than 160,000 disabled people - describing them as a ""step too far, even for this Tory government"". A Lib Dem work and pensions spokeswoman said it was ""utterly outrageous"" the government was using the ruling to ""make matters worse"" for disabled people. ""What makes things even worse is that they have sneaked this announcement out under the cover of [Thursday's] by-elections,"" she said. Campaigners said the government should instead embrace the tribunal's findings. Philip Connolly from Disability Rights UK said the changes showed ""escalating levels of unfairness"" in the government's approach to a benefit it had created. People with ""very serious conditions"" including dementia, learning difficulties and diabetes would be hit, he said. This change was one of several benefit cuts disabled people faced, he said. Campaigners are due to stage a protest in Westminster on Wednesday about a £29-a-week cut to employment support payments. A DWP spokeswoman said the government was ""committed to ensuring our welfare system is a strong safety net for those who need it. ""That's why we spend around £50bn a year to support people with disabilities and health conditions.""",formal

"Transgender protesters forced a halt to debate on the bill on Wednesday. Last month, the state approved a human rights measure banning gender identity discrimination at public facilities. In recent weeks, two other states passed laws ensuring equal access to gender-segregated facilities for transgender students. The bill in Arizona's Republican-dominated legislature would make it a misdemeanour offence to use a public toilet, bathroom, shower, bath, dressing room or changing room associated with a gender other than what is on one's birth certificate. Penalties could include six months in prison. ""If you look like a man and you live your life like a man, you should be able to use a man's bathroom,"" said Dru Levasseur, a transgender rights lawyer for the advocacy group Lambda Legal. But John Kavanagh, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said he feared criminals might take advantage of the situation and expose themselves to children of the opposite gender. ""This law simply restores the law of society: men are men and women are women,"" Mr Kavanagh said, according to the Associated Press. ""For a handful of people to make everyone else uncomfortable just makes no sense."" But, Mr Kavanagh added, police would be allowed to use their discretion over whether to press charges if women used the men's room to avoid a long queue. On Wednesday, Mr Kavanagh agreed to postpone a vote on the bill at the start of a hearing filled with dozens of transgender activists. The bill's opponents say it would force transgender people to reveal themselves and risk harassment, ""Most transgender people try to slip through public places without being noticed,'' activist Erica Keppler said. ""This will turn us into criminals."" And advocates say transgender people can find it difficult to change gender on their birth certificates because many states require proof of gender treatment surgery. Meanwhile, other states such as Idaho and Ohio do not allow such changes at all, the American Civil Liberties Union said. It is already illegal to discriminate against transgender people in 16 US states, although the extent of protections can vary, the group added. In an ongoing case, a Colorado family has filed a complaint against the state after their six-year-old, who was born a boy, was banned from using the girl's bathroom at her primary school.",formal
"Jhoppa's point is the main one; just like there can be a HUGE difference in concentration of THC between different plants (genetic engineering aside, lots of things like soil/climate/etc. can influence it), there can be large variation in concentration of mescaline among different cacti. I'd say the amount you have will almost certainly be enough to feel it, and is very unlikely to be too intense...If you've never done mescaline, let me try to describe it. A trip is like a roller-coaster ride, right? It's intense, it's exhilarating, it's fun, but at times can also be scary, depending on specifics about the particular ride (shoddy state fair roller coaster vs. Cedar Point) as well as your mindset going on to it (you're unlikely to enjoy even an awesome roller coaster if you're sick/upset etc.). Just like set and setting for a trip. Now, acid or shrooms are more like...Son of Beast from Kings Island in Ohio; it's the biggest wooden roller-coaster in the world. Which means that, it's intense and really awesome, but it has kind of a rickety feel to it that doesn't leave you feeling completely safe/secure/worry-free the whole time. Mescaline, on the other hand, is the Millenium Force. It takes you higher and faster than almost any other ride, but the whole time you feel completely safe, secure, in control, and are just *loving* it. (DMT, obviously, would be the Top Thrill Dragster =P ) Mescaline just feels so clean and exhilarating and everything is so amazingly beautiful. It's the strongest positive/euphoric ""push"" I've ever felt from a psychedelic, besides maybe 2C-P (or candyflipping). This is due to mescaline's phenethylamine structure; it is chemically more similar to MDMA or even amphetamine than to tryptamines like psilocybin (acid has structural similarities to both families). In the type of dose you should be getting yourself into, it's an *extremely* functional trip. To give you an example, the first time I met and really got to know my current girlfriend of 2 years (we were neighbors in a dorm, this was the first time we hung out), my roommates and I were all tripping balls on mescaline. I had invited her and her roommate over at our place for dinner (cooked by me) to get to know each other. Now, her and her roommate are these two beautiful girls who we don't know at all and who (we would come to know but suspected) are totally innocent--neither of them had ever even drank or partied, much less smoked weed or done anything else. Anyway, while tripping balls on mescaline, I cooked a dinner for 5 people, we all had awesome conversation (despite being around new people who also happened to be gorgeous--probably would have been weird on acid or shrooms), they had no idea we were on anything and yeah long story short we've been dating for over 2 years based on *that* first impression. That's still one of, if not the most magical day of my life (first mescaline trip). For reference, that was on 40 0.7g capsules (so 28g) of powdered dried Peruvian Torch cactus.

"I agree with Khael8. That being said, I might recommend something other than a game design degree. If you're interested in the programming side (as it seems you are), I would suggest Computer Science or Software Engineering. Not as a side lesson like it would be for a game design degree, but as a full on course of study. There are a couple reasons for that. First, if you pick a game design degree, there's a good chance you're going to be stuck, and if you ever change your mind about your career down the line, you're out of luck. With CS or SE you're a lot more marketable and you'll have more flexibility when it comes to your career. Next, you'll learn more programming doing this than a game design degree. And if you want to work for a developer, the usual jack of all trades type person isn't always what they want. Many developers want someone who is VERY good at a specific thing. They want their artists to be great artists, their audio guys to be great with audio, and they want their programmers to be great programmers. *Normally* they don't need their programmers being great with sound and graphics, just the programming behind the implementations. This way, you'll be great at programming and along the way you can pick up the tools that artists use and learn those so you're at least familiar with them should you need to use it by yourself. TL;DR: I recommend CS or SE as more suitable degrees. Also, get an internship.",informal

"It isn't a matter of mechanics, not really. You're thinking of it from an engineering viewpoint, when you should be thinking of it from a business standpoint. Granted injection molding isn't going to just disappear, but for applications where the costs involved are cheaper to 3D print on location, rather than wait for delivery and pay transportation (think big construction products) - yes, for those applications 3d printing is going to be absolutely necessary. I work in shipping (so slightly different than your IM example but bear with me), and i'd gladly pay $500k to have a machine that could print a critical part on demand in steel. That may not be even 5 years away! I've had to have ships wait on demurrage of $30k a day, for 7 or 8 days at a time waiting for a fucking man hatch cover to be finished, shipped and installed on site so that the USCG will clear the vessel as seaworthy. Essentially, that hatch cover cost me $200k. If I could make one on site, the difference in price between the regular making of one, and mass production argument you are making doesn't matter. I'd be a fool not to pick a 3D printed version every time. Even if it's 30x more expensive than a mass produced unit on a unit cost basis.

"ALGIERS, Algeria (CNN) -- Rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the United Nations headquarters in Algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building's facade and leveled nearby U.N. offices. Rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building. It was one of two suspected car bombs that struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other. The death toll is unclear: the official government count is at least 26, but hospital sources in Algiers told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that 76 people were killed in the two blasts. A statement from the United Nations said 45 people were reported killed. Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni blamed a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court. In a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility. CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, but the Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from al Qaeda and other militant groups. In the posting, the bombers were identified as Sheikh Ibrahim Abu Othman and Abdel Rahman Abu Abdel Nasser al-Asimi. It said two trucks were filled with ""no less than 800 kg (1,763 pounds) of explosives."" The group called the operation ""another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood, defending the wounded Islamic nation and in defiance to the Crusaders and their agents, the slaves of America and the sons of France."" At least 10 U.N. staffers were among those killed, according to U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe. The offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees -- located across the street from the U.N. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday. ""Our offices are basically destroyed now, nothing works,"" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said from its Geneva headquarters. Watch his full interview . He said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped U.N. workers. ""It's a very serious situation still with the U.N. in Algiers,"" he said. In a strongly worded statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called ""an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity's highest ideals under the U.N. banner."" ""The perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by Algerian authorities and the international community,"" Ban said in the written statement. He said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort. Most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the Constitutional Council -- which oversees elections -- and Supreme Court in the Algiers neighborhood of Ben Aknoun, according to the state-run Algeria Press Agency. That blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board, the news agency reported. One man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. ""I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me. I had to run away from the car,"" he said. Zerhouni said the attack was the work of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), the same group that took responsibility for an attack in April in downtown Algiers that killed 33 people. That group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda earlier this year. It abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al Qaeda. CNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton said the merger combined the expertise of Algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al Qaeda in North Africa, enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of Algiers. She said the group's goal is to destabilize countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which it sees as enemies of the Islamic state. Zerhouni said police interrogations of GSPC members arrested in the wake of the April attack revealed that Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court were on a list of GSPC targets. Algeria, which has a population of 33 million, is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Islamist party was poised to win. Tens of thousands of people died in the unrest. Although the country has remained relatively peaceful, recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence.

The world number four went straight to the practice green after taking 35 putts in round one but he said his efforts on Friday, when he took 30, were ""pathetic"". ""Putting let me down at [the US Open in June at] Oakmont and then putting let me down here again,"" he said. ""My tee to green game - there's not much wrong with that. It's pretty solid. If you had given anyone else in this field my tee shots this week, they would have been up near the top of the leaderboard. ""It just shows you how bad I was around the greens."" The Swede was grouped with the year's other two major winners - Masters champion Danny Willett and US Open victor Dustin Johnson - and he outscored them on both days. He dropped to one under par after three-putt bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes but a three-foot eagle putt on the par-five 18th, his ninth, followed by three birdies on the front nine, moved him one clear of the field. ""I got off to a bit of a wobbly start and stood over a six-foot putt on the 14th to avoid going three over, so I'm quite happy that went in and I turned it on from 18,"" said the 40-year-old, who won his first major at Royal Troon two weeks ago. ""That could easily have gone the wrong way but I was hanging in there and got the good stuff coming in."" Willett birdied the ninth to card a 70 and make the cut on one over, but pre-tournament favourite Johnson is going home after adding a 72 to his opening 77 for a nine-over total. Neither American has never won a major and while Walker has five victories on the PGA Tour, Streb has just one and has missed nine cuts in 23 events in 2016. Walker, 37, made a solid start to round two with two birdies and seven pars in his opening nine holes before moving clear of the field with a run of three successive birdies from the 12th. He pulled his tee shot on the 17th into a hospitality area and escaped with a free drop and par five but an almost identical shot on the last was not so lucky, ending up in a lake and resulting in a dropped shot. ""The finish wasn't what I was looking for, but it's fine,"" said Walker. ""I think you take 66 at any tournament all day every day. So it's good. ""I will watch the leaderboard on Saturday. I don't think that's a big deal. I enjoy watching it. I think you need to know where you are at."" Streb started on the 10th and had four birdies and a bogey in his opening nine holes and closed with three in four holes to become the 30th player to card a 63 in a major - no player has ever shot a 62. The 29-year-old, who missed the cut at each of the first three majors of 2016, said he turned up this week ""just to see if I could play some good golf and have fun"". He added: ""Obviously it's going pretty well, but my expectations are pretty low, which maybe is a good thing."" Day was Friday's other big mover, knocking in seven birdies in eight holes from the eighth to sit two off the lead. ""I kind of gave myself a little bit of a kick up the bum with the double bogey on seven,"" he said. ""It was a bit of a mess but to come back and birdie eight and nine made things a lot better for me on the back nine."" Former world number one and two-time major winner Spieth had five birdies in his opening nine holes to get to four under par but missed several opportunities to better his score on his back nine, while a bogey saw him close on three under. ""It was a really solid round and I'm back in contention,"" said the American. ""I'm hitting the ball fantastic. I just can't get a putt to go in from beyond 10 feet."" Kaymer, who started at four under, began the front and back nines with bogeys but three birdies in his last four holes lifted him to five under. ""I made a few putts here and there. I enjoyed the last few holes,"" he said. ""It was important for me to finish the way I did."" Andrew Johnston continued to impress in the majors, after finishing tied for eighth at The Open, with a one-under-par 69 to reach halfway at one under. The Englishman, better known by his nickname 'Beef', started on the 10th and was two under after nine holes. He dropped back to level with bogeys on the fifth and seventh holes, but he then birdied the eighth. ""Every hole, man, I get so many nice comments,"" said the 27-year-old. ""Even after the fifth hole, when I three-putted, they are like, 'Don't worry, Beef, come on, bounce back, you've got this one'. And it's just nice, man. It's a nice atmosphere."" Lee Westwood (70) hit 92% of greens in regulation as he also finished on one under, alongside fellow Englishmen Ross Fisher (73) and Tyrrell Hatton (68). Andy Sullivan, who reached five under, dropped away with six bogeys in nine holes through the middle of his round before finishing birdie-eagle on the two par-five finishing holes to post a 71 and a two-under total that matched Paul Casey (69). Scotland's Russell Knox is also playing the weekend after a second 70 left him level par, along with Wales' Bradley Dredge. English pair Matthew Fitzpatrick (70) and Justin Rose (72) beat the cut by one shot.",formal
"From a chemical standpoint, it has to do with the incorporation of fat and liquids in your final product. Cookie dough is an emulsion - a mixture of two compounds (fat and water) that can't usually bond. Emulsions are fragile by nature, and prone to breaking. Keeping cookie dough too long at room temperature, over handling while shaping - these are things that will ""break"" your emulsion, and cause the fat to separate into the oily substance you sometimes find in flat cookies. Chilling your dough before forming and before baking, and any time that it begins to get overwarm, helps to keep the dough intact. The greatest benefit, however, is during baking itself. Cookie recipes are often chemically leavened - with baking powder or baking soda. And cookie recipes often contain butter. Butter is itself an emulsion, being composed of several parts fat (about 80% in the states) and water (along with small quantities of sugar and protein). When butter is heated in a mixture like cookie dough, one of two things may happen: The emulsion may break, and the fat begin to leak, OR the water may turn to steam, creating small pockets of water vapor that act as barriers to fat and help the product to rise. Bringing your dough rapidly from chilled to oven temperature allows water to steam before the fat melts, keeping your cookie in one happy, homogeneous package - instead of spread onto your baking sheet. TL;DR: Fat and water don't bond.",informal
"Head of the Army General Sir Nick Carter said the move was about trying to operate ""smarter"". The 77th Brigade, made up of reservists and regular troops and based in Hermitage, Berkshire, will be formally created in April. It has been inspired by the Chindits who fought in Burma in World War Two. An Army spokesman said the unit would ""play a key part in enabling the UK to fight in the information age"" and that it ""consists of more than just traditional capabilities"". He said: ""77 Brigade is being created to draw together a host of existing and developing capabilities essential to meet the challenges of modern conflict and warfare. ""It recognises that the actions of others in a modern battlefield can be affected in ways that are not necessarily violent and it draws heavily on important lessons from our commitments to operations in Afghanistan amongst others."" Recruitment for the brigade, 42% of whose personnel will be reservists, will begin this spring. Its members will come from the Royal Navy and RAF as well as from the Army. One former commander of British forces in Afghanistan has warned the new operation should not mean fewer troops on the frontline. Colonel Richard Kemp said: ""My view is that this should not be done at the expense of combat troops. Where are these 2,000 people going to come from?"" ""They are likely to come from savings made in combat troops. I think that's a mistake. ""I think the British forces have already been cut far too much in a very uncertain and increasingly dangerous world. He acknowledged the need for this type of innovation, but said ""it should be added to the forces, not created out of savings found elsewhere."" The creation of the new unit is part of a major restructuring of the military under the Army 2020 plan, which will see the military scaled down to around 82,000 regular troops in the next five years. The unit will also seek ""new ways of allowing civilians with bespoke skills to serve alongside their military counterparts"". The Army spokesman said it would share the ""spirit of innovation"" of the Chindits in the Burma Campaign of 1942 to 1945. Chindits was the name given to the Long Range Penetration (LRP) groups that operated in the Burmese jungle behind enemy lines, targeting Japanese communications. The new unit will also use the old Chindit insignia of a Chinthe, a mythical Burmese creature which is half-lion and half-dragon. Tony Redding from Kent, whose father was in the Chindits, told the BBC he was disappointed by the move. He said: ""Sadly the Ministry of Defence didn't inform the surviving Chindit veterans of the decision to use the badge in this way. ""I've tried very hard to look for similarities and the only common denominator I can find is that the Chindits 70 years ago were a highly unconventional force. Perhaps this new force are to use some unconventional means of warfare."" By BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale The Army says it's learnt valuable lessons from Afghanistan - not least that it can't win wars using pure military force alone. The brigade will be made up of warriors who don't just carry weapons, but who are also skilled in using social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and the dark arts of ""psyops"" - psychological operations. They will try to influence local populations and change behaviour through what the Army calls traditional and unconventional means. Civilians with the right skills will work alongside regular troops and reservists and could be sent anywhere in the world to help win hearts and minds. It can be seen as proof that the Army is adapting to modern asymmetric warfare, and that it remains relevant at a time when there are fears within the British military of more cuts after the election. Paul Rogers, a professor of international security at the University of Bradford, said the announcement represented a ""big expansion"" of the Army's psychological operations and was an ""attempt to rebrand and update"" this area of its work. ""We had so much difficulty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's about trying to learn the lessons of how these groups are using social media,"" Prof Rogers explained. He added: ""In some senses it's defensive - trying to present the case from this side against opponents who hold many of the cards. ""We've seen with Islamic State, its incredible capability on the net, Facebook, Instagram and all the rest."" A former Army officer involved in psychological operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, Simon Bergman, predicted it would help build ""the Army for the future"". ""For example, 77 brigade have a large component of civil affairs soldiers who'll be operating in populations, working with them, achieving military effects - and a broader effect, because as we know from Afghanistan, the military doesn't work in isolation. It works as a component of government.""",formal
"Lifelong fan Hearn sold the club to the Italian for £4m in July 2014. This week the club was served with a winding-up petition from Revenue & Customs for non-payment of tax, with a High Court hearing set for 20 March. ""Looking where we are now, I would never have sold if I had thought this was going to happen,"" Hearn said. ""Hindsight is a wonderful advisor."" He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""At the time I thought it was perfect for everybody - fans, myself, the club."" Hearn, who was Orient chairman for 19 years, said when the takeover was completed, he and fans were ""pretty certain"" that Becchetti, who made a fortune in waste management and recycling, would prove to be a good owner. ""He had a very engaging personality,"" the 68-year-old said. ""He seemed passionate about what he wanted to do, and he has done what he told me he was going to do - he has injected many, many millions of pounds into Leyton Orient. ""It is just that putting the money in, and spending it wisely are not always the same things."" A meeting of the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust (Loft) on Thursday night agreed on what the group calls ""a last-resort measure"" to try to save the relegation-threatened club. Should Becchetti not pay the tax bill before the court date, then at the winding-up hearing the fans would seek the appointment of an administrator, despite the fact it would mean the club being deducted 12 points under English Football League rules. An administrator would then look to sell the club as a going concern to a potential new owner. ""That application would be made as late as possible to give the club's current owner time to settle the bill,"" said Loft spokesman Tom Davies. However, he added that should an adjournment of the court hearing provide a more stable course and future for the club, then they would favour an adjournment. In addition, Loft has launched a crowd funding page to try to raise £250,000 - reportedly the tax sum owed by the club. Loft also want to meet Hearn, still the chairman of World Snooker, to discuss its plans for saving the club. ""I have been a bit critical of fans' trusts in the past up and down the country. Some of them have worked, but some of them have been abysmal failures,"" he said. ""But I think they should be encouraged and applauded for looking at the situation. It comes down to what plan they have in their mind, what is the sustainability of the club within that plan and what management, because it is all about management."" Hearn still owns Orient's Matchroom Stadium. But for that, he believes it could have been sold for redevelopment. ""Fortunately Leyton Orient have got a 20-year lease on the ground, with another 20-year option. I did it on purpose because I could never be 100% sure where I was selling,"" he added. ""I kept the ground to make sure it wasn't used for the wrong reasons - that it wasn't the wrong reasons for buying a football club. Thank goodness I kept it because I would imagine now, with the situation it is, developers would be knocking on the door tomorrow."" When asked by BBC Sport, Leyton Orient declined to respond to Hearn's remarks or comment on Loft's proposals.",formal

"GLASGOW, Scotland -- World champions Italy clinched qualification for Euro 2008 after goals in the first and last minutes gave them a pulsating 2-1 victory at Hampden Park -- killing off Scotland's hopes of reaching the finals. Luca Toni celebrates his early goal as Italy won 2-1 in Scotland to clinch qualification from Group B. Luca Toni shot Italy in front but Scotland recovered to dominate and Barry Ferguson bundled home a 65th-minute leveller. However, Christian Panucci headed an injury-time winner after a controversial decision to award Italy a free-kick. The result also means France have sealed qualification, along with Italy, from Group B without playing a game. In a match played in torrential rain, Italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds. Gianluca Zambrotta spotted Antonio Di Natale unmarked in the box, and picked him out with a throw-in as Scotland were caught napping. Di Natale swept the ball into the path of Toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out. The home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later. This time, Toni turned provider and his cut-back was met by Mauro Camoranesi who fired over from close-range. Toni then shrugged off two challenges before drawing a decent save from Craig Gordon with a well-struck effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post. At the other end, Scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a thunderous drive from Lee McCulloch appeared to be handled by Zambrotta inside the area but penalty claims were ignored. Spurred on by a sense of injustice, the hosts cranked up the pressure on their visitors. Ferguson fired over from a James McFadden corner, before Alan Hutton nodded agonisingly wide of the upright following another perfect delivery from the Everton man. Scotland then produced some wonderful passing football, which culminated in a tight-angled drive from Ferguson, but Gianluigi Buffon dived low to smother. Then came another scare for the home side. Gordon was forced to pull a save out of the top drawer to deny a point-blank effort from Massimo Ambrosini, before Di Natale rifled the rebound into the back of the net. The assistant referee raised his flag for offside but television replays suggested the official may have called it wrong. Only last-gasp defending from the Italians prevented the Scots from grabbing a morale-boosting leveller on the stroke of half-time. David Weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet Ferguson's corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner before Andrea Pirlo somehow managed to nod off the line. A free-kick in a dangerous area provided Italy with the chance to start the second half as emphatically as they had started the first when Paul Hartley hauled down Camoranesi just outside the box. Pirlo seized on the chance and looped the ball over the wall but, despite a reputation as a dead-ball specialist, his effort was easily dealt with by Gordon. Instead, it was Scotland who found the back of the net as Hampden erupted with 65 minutes gone. McFadden's free-kick deflected into the path of McCulloch in front of goal. He was denied by Buffon, but the rebound fell kindly to Ferguson and the captain gratefully rifled home from close-range. With just over 15 minutes to go, Scott Brown was withdrawn for Kenny Miller as Scotland went for broke. The Derby striker quickly began to cause the Italians problems and delivered a wonderful diagonal cross to the feet of McFadden but he fired wide when it looked easier score. Scotland's impossible dream ended in the cruellest possible way when Italy snatched a last minute goal to secure their own qualification for Euro 2008. Hutton appeared to be barged over in front of the corner flag but the referee inexplicably awarded the free-kick the other way and Panucci rose to meet Pirlo's cross and nod home the winner. Italy coach Roberto Donadoni said: ""We knew it was going to be a physical match given the atmosphere. ""But through their character and desire, the lads were fantastic. They worked so hard, they deserve this. Qualifying for Euro 2008 is amazing. It's something positive after all that happened last week (the death of the Lazio fan)."" Captain Fabio Cannavaro: ""This was a victory won with the heart. It was difficult to play in this stadium, with that atmosphere it was like a cauldron. ""We played really well and managed to win. We showed once again that we are a strong and compact team and when we need to win we do everything to show that we are the world champions.

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The garbage crisis in Naples encompasses the worst Italian clichés, and in particular those of the southern part of this lovely peninsula: mismanagement, political interference, mafia profiteering and the ability of those responsible to deflect the attention and the blame elsewhere. Naples has had problems in finding sites for municipal dumps -- now workers have stopped collecting trash. There is a popular saying here that roughly goes like this: everybody is competent enough (to find a solution) but nobody is responsible (for actually carrying it out). In many parts of the world waste disposal is a business -- and usually it is a good business. Garbage can be transformed into various sources of energy and then sold for a profit. In Naples, garbage is also good business, but in the sense that millions, if not billions, of euros have been wasted -- and nobody really knows how. The problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash. The region's dumps reached full capacity more than a decade ago, and since then a state of emergency has been declared every year. Eight different commissioners have been appointed, but they have all failed to solve the problem. State of emergency means government money: €1.8 billion (more than $2.5 billion) in emergency funds have been devolved to deal with the problem. It is still difficult to find out where or how that money has been spent. Incinerators that were supposed to be built were never finished, either because the companies in charge of constructing them could not finish the job, or else because magistrates stopped the work, pending ongoing criminal investigations into alleged mafia involvement. One Italian newspaper suggested that a good 20% of the money went to pay for the salaries of those in charge of coming up with a solution to the problem. More worrying perhaps, is another suggestion: that the local mafia, known as the Camorra, is taking advantage of the situation. As the crisis has worsened over the years, so the Camorra's profits, estimated now at around €1 billion (roughly $1.45 billion), are alleged to have increased. How does the local mafia make money? The Naples prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts which otherwise would have to be checked by complicated anti-racketeering legislation. Once they receive the money, companies linked to the underworld dispose of the waste either in the open or, ironically, at regular city dumps, even if they are overflowing. The mafia clans have now managed to burrow their way so deeply into the system that every attempt to fix the problem has proved futile. But why are citizens protesting now? Well, the government wants to re-open a previously shut dump to dispose of 3,700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of Naples and surrounding areas. The problem is that when the site was closed years ago, locals were promised that a golf course would be built there. As a result, many residents invested savings to construct apartments and residences in the vicinity -- in some cases just a few yards away from the site. They are now waking up to a mountain of trash instead of 18 holes. A rotten deal indeed. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"The Conservative leader said a future government led by him would build 100,000 new homes for such people. They would be built on brownfield land already identified for development and exempt from some taxes, he said. He was speaking as the party prepares for its annual conference this weekend. Conservative politicians and activists will gather in Birmingham from Sunday for what is the final conference before next May's general election. Unveiling the pledge - an extension of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme - Mr Cameron said the Conservatives wanted more young people to ""achieve the dream"" of owning their own home. ""I want young people who work hard, who do the right thing, to be able to buy a home of their own. So these starter homes will be sold at 20% less than the market value. ""They can't be bought by foreigners, they can't be bought by buy-to-let landlords, they can't be flipped round in a quick sale. They can only be bought by hard working people under the age of 40."" The starter homes plan would apply only to England, whereas Help to Buy is UK-wide. That scheme entails the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of new-build properties. Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said Mr Cameron had presided over the lowest level of house building in peacetime since the 1920s. ""After four and a half years he now tells us that he is going to deliver for first-time buyers but under his government a record one in four young people are living at home with their parents and young people across the country are priced out of home ownership. ""Labour will make the fundamental changes to the market which are urgently needed and will double the number of first-time buyers in the next 10 years."" Campbell Robb, of homelessness charity Shelter, welcomed the pledge but said it was ""absolutely vital"" that the homes built were ""genuinely affordable for young couples and families on ordinary incomes"". ""There's a real concern that removing the requirement on developers to build affordable housing means this policy may not help those facing the greatest struggle to get a home of their own,"" he said. Grainia Long, of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said she welcomed ""the focus on supply and affordability"" but still had ""some serious concerns"". She said: ""This smacks of building for one group of people at the expense of another. ""Social housing is critical if we are going to solve the housing crisis - there are always going to be people who can't afford to buy and we must provide decent, affordable homes for them too. ""Equally, we'd like to see more investment in shared ownership to help people on lower incomes. If all the focus is on home ownership, we are never going to build mixed communities."" Under the new proposals, the homes would be built on brownfield land which was no longer needed for industrial or commercial use. Savings from using such land would be passed on to the buyers, the Conservatives said. Public sector land would also be used to deliver the pledge. The homes would be exempt ""from a raft of taxes"", Mr Cameron said, such as the community infrastructure levy and a requirement to build social housing as part of any development. Some building regulations - including the zero carbon homes standard - would also not apply to the new units. The zero carbon homes standard, which applies from 2016, aims to improve energy efficiency. It requires house builders to decrease all carbon emissions from energy arising from fixed heating and lighting, hot water and other fixed building services - such as ventilation - in new homes.",formal
"(CNN) -- Federal Emergency Management Agency officials know the agency's performance in the California wildfires will be watched closely for comparisons to its failures in Hurricane Katrina. A volunteer distributes donated food and supplies to evacueesTuesday at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium. FEMA Director David Paulison promised on Tuesday ""a different type of response than the federal government put together for Katrina."" Paulison said Katrina ""was a wake-up call"" and that ""this is a new FEMA."" President Bush signed a federal disaster declaration Wednesday, freeing up federal funds for families affected by the wildfires in seven counties in Southern California. ""I will continue to make sure that our efforts are coordinated, that we are responding to the needs of people, but most importantly I want the people in Southern California to know that Americans all across this land care deeply about them,"" he said. The action follows an emergency declaration by Bush on Tuesday morning for the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. He said he's ""looking forward"" to his visit to the region on Thursday. According to a statement from the White House, the federal disaster declaration will allow for federal aid that ""can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster."" FEMA and other relief and rescue services face significantly different challenges in the fire zone than they did on the Gulf Coast in 2005. For example, the fires aren't covering every square foot of the region, as Katrina did. The devastation in California is intense but not universal. During and immediately after Katrina, the destruction was so complete that relief personnel and supplies -- even the U.S. Army -- could not get within miles of the disaster's epicenter, New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward, for several days. By contrast, roads in Southern California have remained open for residents to get out and help to get in without delay. Residents there are generally more affluent and are able to use their own vehicles to escape, whereas many of Katrina's victims were poor and had no means of transportation. Victims in California are not stranded on rooftops without food or drinkable water, but are able travel the relatively short distances to safe places. One of those safe places is San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, which is not endangered by the fires. FEMA and other relief agencies are able to stage supplies and meet victims' needs in an organized way. New Orleans' Superdome, on the other hand, sitting in the center of the disaster zone, was severely damaged by hurricane winds and threatened by rising water. What had been a shelter devolved into a trap. Katrina also wiped out the Gulf Coast's communications infrastructure, crippling the coordination of relief efforts -- even for the military. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff acknowledged Tuesday that the government's response machinery had benefited from the Katrina experience. ""I think there's no question that [there were] a couple of the lessons from Katrina which we have put into effect here,"" Chertoff said. ""First of all, planning and preparation in advance for these kinds of challenges, so that we have worked together and planned together with the Defense Department and with state authorities well in advance of the crisis. That's been a big help here,"" Chertoff said . ""Second, we have really flooded the zone as quickly as possible by staging assets to deal both with the firefighting issue and with the response issue,"" Chertoff said. Chertoff said federal officials began discussing over the weekend the need to have FEMA ready, ""and as we saw the evacuation issue becoming more prominent, and the number of people seeking shelter becoming more prominent, we sprang into action yesterday. ""So we've been monitoring the situation continuously. The president's been on top of it. We've been on top of it. And we're going to continue to stay ahead of this as far as we can."" Chertoff said Tuesday that he hadn't waited for the paperwork to be signed before staging assistance. ""We have been moving cots, blankets, other supplies into the area of San Diego so that we can handle any necessity for additional sheltering capacity,"" he said. ""We've also moved air assets to be poised to take flight when we do have the opportunity to deal with the fire, once the winds begin to die down."" People left homeless by the fires can already go online to apply for federal help at www.fema.gov, Paulison said. Watch Paulison discuss the ""new FEMA"" » . He denied suggestions similar to those made in the aftermath of Katrina that the federal response was hampered because National Guard equipment was in short supply because of the Iraq War. ""I just haven't seen that,"" he said. The U.S. military has sent aircraft to help fight the fires, including 11 Defense Department helicopters equipped with water buckets and six C-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant. More than 17,000 National Guardsmen have been made available; 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego; and 12 Defense Department firefighting teams, were engaged.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. first lady Laura Bush -- in a rare foray into foreign policy -- called on Myanmar's military junta to ""step aside,"" give up the ""terror campaigns"" against its people and allow for a democratic Myanmar in a commentary published in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. U.S. first lady Laura Bush said the junta ""should step aside to make way for a unified Burma."" ""Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies are a friendless regime,"" Bush said. ""They should step aside to make way for a unified Burma [Myanmar] governed by legitimate leaders. ""The rest of the armed forces should not fear this transition -- there is room for a professional military in a democratic Burma,"" Bush said, in keeping with the U.S. policy of still using Myanmar's former name. In Wednesday's commentary, Bush called on Myanmar's military leaders to release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders so they can meet with and plan for a transition to democracy. ""Meanwhile, the world watches -- and waits,"" Bush warns. ""We know that Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies have the advantage of violent force. But Ms. Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders have moral legitimacy, the support of the Burmese people and the support of the world. ""The regime's position grows weaker by the day. The generals' choice is clear: The time for a free Burma is now."" The humanitarian rights situation in Myanmar has been a cause for the first lady in the past few months as the crisis there worsened. Myanmar state media has reported that 2,000 people were detained during the demonstrations and the crackdown against them -- under an emergency law imposed on September 25 banning assembly of more than five people -- and that 700 of those people have been released. The official death toll from Myanmar's leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September, which were led by Myanmar's Buddhist monks. On Tuesday morning, Bush received a phone call from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to update her on the efforts of his special envoy to Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari. A representative of the secretary general said the call was a follow-up to a conversation they had weeks ago. Gambari met last week with the military junta leadership as well as with Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest in Yangon. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, told reporters that Laura Bush and her husband's administration believe that there is a ""need to start preparing for transition"" for Myanmar. ""We believe it is very important that progress be made and prisoners be released and conditions for Aun Sung Suu Kyi be improved [so] that she can prepare for participation for negotiations for a transition,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Erik Prince, the chairman and CEO of Blackwater USA, appeared Tuesday before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Erik Prince, CEO and chairman of Blackwater USA, is sworn in Tuesday at a congressional hearing. The committee convened amid an FBI investigation into a September 16 shootout involving Blackwater personnel that resulted in the deaths of Iraqi civilians. Following is a transcript of Prince's opening statement: . Chairman [Henry] Waxman, [D-California], Congressman [Thomas] Davis, [R-Virginia], members of the committee, my name is Eric Prince, and I am the chairman and CEO of the Prince Group and Blackwater USA. Blackwater's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to America's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect Americans in harm's way overseas. Under the direction and oversight of the United States government, Blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the United States. Words alone cannot express the respect I have for these brave men and women who defend -- who volunteer to defend U.S. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions. I am proud to be there to represent them today. After almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, I founded Blackwater in 1997. I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues. Ten years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day. After 9/11, when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq, the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas. Blackwater responded immediately. We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country. Blackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans, many of whom have recent military deployments. No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured. There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men. At the same time, 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates. Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed. The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families. The areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging. Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq. We're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis. Any incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe, including visiting members of Congress. In doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy. Blackwater shares the committee's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations. The company's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes, treaties and regulations of the United States. Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented. The worldwide personnel protection services contract, which has been provided to this committee, was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance, including the hiring, vetting guidelines, background checks, screening, training standards, rules of force and conduct standards. In Iraq, Blackwater reports to the embassy's regional security officer, or RSO. All Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO. In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls, the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions, as well as any applicable laws and regulations. We have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation's total force. Blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions. My understanding of the September 16 incident is that the Department of State and the FBI are conducting a full investigation, but those results are not yet available. We at Blackwater welcome the FBI review announced yesterday, and we will cooperate fully and look forward to receiving their conclusions. I just want to put some other things in perspective. A recent report from the Department of State stated that in 2007 Blackwater conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone, areas outside the Green Zone in Iraq, and there have been only 56 incidences in which weapons were discharged, or less than 3 percent of all movements. In 2006, Blackwater conducted over 6,500 diplomatic movements in the Red Zone. Weapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions. To the extent there is any loss of innocent life, ever, let me be clear that I consider that tragic. Every life, whether American or Iraqi, is precious. I stress to the committee and to the American public, however, that I believe we acted appropriately at all times. I am prepared to answer your questions. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"Mr Besigye was the main challenger to President Yoweri Museveni in the country's recent general election, which Mr Museveni won by a landslide. He insists he was the rightful winner of the polls, but Uganda's top court upheld the official result. ""We have been informed by police today that Besigye appeared in court in Moroto and was charged with treason,"" said his lawyer Erias Lukwago. Mr Besigye was arrested on Wednesday in downtown Kampala and flown to Moroto, where he has been in custody ever since. It follows a series of arrests of the opposition leader during the election campaign. Meanwhile, Mr Museveni was sworn in on Thursday for his fifth elective term, extending his 30-year rule of Uganda. Foreign observers said the poll had been marred by fear and intimidation. In a BBC interview, Mr Museveni rejected allegations of vote rigging, and accused Mr Besigye of planning to incite violence. Responding to criticism from European Union observers that the electoral commission ""lacked independence and transparency"", Mr Museveni told the BBC's Zuhura Yunus that ""those Europeans are not serious"". ""Transparency is what we've been voting for,"" he added. Mr Museveni, a key ally of the West in the campaign against militant Islamists in the region, seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda. However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian. On Friday, the US said Mr Museveni should ""rein in"" his security forces after they briefly arrested Mr Besigye, and fired tear gas to disperse his supporters in Kampala.",formal
"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Youssif, the 5-year-old burned Iraqi boy, rounded the corner at Universal Studios when suddenly the little boy hero met his favorite superhero. Youssif has always been a huge Spider-Man fan. Meeting him was ""my favorite thing,"" he said. Spider-Man was right smack dab in front of him, riding a four-wheeler amid a convoy of other superheroes. The legendary climber of buildings and fighter of evil dismounted, walked over to Youssif and introduced himself. Spidey then gave the boy from a far-away land a gentle hug, embracing him in his iconic blue and red tights. He showed Youssif a few tricks, like how to shoot a web from his wrist. Only this time, no web was spun. ""All right Youssif!"" Spider-Man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement. Other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look. Even the Green Goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi. Youssif remained unfazed. He didn't take a liking to Spider-Man's nemesis. Spidey was just too cool. ""It was my favorite thing,"" the boy said later. ""I want to see him again."" He then felt compelled to add: ""I know it's not the real Spider-Man."" This was the day of dreams when the boy's nightmares were, at least temporarily, forgotten. He met SpongeBob, Lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named Archie. The hairy, brownish-red primate took to the boy, grabbing his hand and holding it. Even when Youssif pulled away, Archie would inch his hand back toward the boy's and then snatch it. See Youssif enjoy being a boy again » . The boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns. It was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central Baghdad, as recently as a week ago. He squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could. He rode a tram through the back stages at Universal Studios. At one point, the car shook. Fire and smoke filled the air, debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle. The boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed. ""Even I was scared,"" the dad said. ""Well, I wasn't,"" Youssif replied. The father and mother grinned from ear to ear throughout the day. Youssif pushed his 14-month-old sister, Ayaa, in a stroller. ""Did you even need to ask us if we were interested in coming here?"" Youssif's father said in amazement. ""Other than my wedding day, this is the happiest day of my life,"" he said. Just a day earlier, the mother and father talked about their journey out of Iraq and to the United States. They also discussed that day nine months ago when masked men grabbed their son outside the family home, doused him in gas and set him on fire. His mother heard her boy screaming from inside. The father sought help for his boy across Baghdad, but no one listened. He remembers his son's two months of hospitalization. The doctors didn't use anesthetics. He could hear his boy's piercing screams from the other side of the hospital. Watch Youssif meet his doctor and play with his little sister » . The father knew that speaking to CNN would put his family's lives in jeopardy. The possibility of being killed was better than seeing his son suffer, he said. ""Anything for Youssif,"" he said. ""We had to do it."" They described a life of utter chaos in Baghdad. Neighbors had recently given birth to a baby girl. Shortly afterward, the father was kidnapped and killed. Then, there was the time when some girls wore tanktops and jeans. They were snatched off the street by gunmen. The stories can be even more gruesome. The couple said they had heard reports that a young girl was kidnapped and beheaded --and her killers sewed a dog's head on the corpse and delivered it to her family's doorstep. ""These are just some of the stories,"" said Youssif's mother, Zainab. Under Saddam Hussein, there was more security and stability, they said. There was running water and electricity most of the time. But still life was tough under the dictator, like the time when Zainab's uncle disappeared and was never heard from again after he read a ""religious book,"" she said. Sitting in the parking lot of a Target in suburban Los Angeles, Youssif's father watched as husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, parents and their children, came and went. Some held hands. Others smiled and laughed. ""Iraq finished,"" he said in what few English words he knows. He elaborated in Arabic: His homeland won't be enjoying such freedoms anytime soon. It's just not possible. Too much violence. Too many killings. His two children have only seen war. But this week, the family has seen a much different side of America -- an outpouring of generosity and a peaceful nation at home. ""It's been a dream,"" the father said. He used to do a lot of volunteer work back in Baghdad. ""Maybe that's why I'm being helped now,"" the father said. At Universal Studios, he looked out across the valley below. The sun glistened off treetops and buildings. It was a picturesque sight fit for a Hollywood movie. ""Good America, good America,"" he said in English. E-mail to a friend .

"You love yourself more than her. That's not inherently wrong, at your age this is natural. You should probably leave her though because you will hurt her in the end. I won't advocate changing yourself to her expectations because I think her expectations do not take you into account either. I think both of you would be better off with more compatible people. I use drugs a lot like you do. I'm not opposed to a bump of coke or two a couple times a year when it's around, I'll eat some mushrooms on a camping trip in the woods every couple years or so for a good cerebral dump and wipe, I smoke marijuana fairly regularly it's a good way to unwind with a beer at the end of the day, I drink beer and have begun brewing my own because it's a fun hobby, and I enjoy smoking cigars with my dad or my uncles when we have time to visit. My girlfriend and I live together and I've never pushed anything on her. She is aware of how I take my pleasure by the dose sometimes. She enjoys beer, and has taken an interest in brewing so we have a shared hobby, and the occasional toke, but has no interest in other drugs. I don't need her to take drugs to validate myself, and she doesn't require me to abstain to appease her own self-interest. We are compatible and sensible with each other. This is how we are and I wouldn't change her, and she doesn't need to change me. However I have a problem with your story. Why do you feel the need to validate yourself by pressuring her to use these substances the way you do? It's obvious she has no interest. On the other hand she is asking the same of you from a different perspective, that you abstain like her. It's obvious you have no interest to change either. There's your answer, staring you right in the face. If you have experienced such incompatibility on such regular intervals over the same issue which neither of you have an interest in changing, then stop beating yourself up. Give up on this rollercoaster because it is emotionally draining and hurtful for both of you. You are young, probably intelligent, and have a lot of time ahead of you. Learn from this and be yourself. You are yourself, she is herself, and if either has to change to fit the other's expectations, when these expectations are unreal, then be yourself by yourself and not what she wants you to be. I don't think you're going to be able to compromise with your current attitude about drugs. You need to find somebody less hung up on your drug use, and you also need to reexamine why you need her so badly to ""try before you say no"" to validate your own use. You yourself validate your own actions, no one else. Own that and get yourself out of this relationship before you damage yourselves even further. There are millions of other girls out there who could make a better match for you. Probably an older you, because I think I've been you and I think you still have some growing up to do before you commit to long term relationships especially ones as emotionally draining as this one. You're only 23 and you've been with her since 18? I've seen this happen in my own friends' relationships and it's usually an impediment to adulthood. Think about it, you've been together since you were children. You've become emotionally dependent on each other even though you're both growing up into very different adults. Time to move on and into your own adulthood and stop holding each other back. It can be an amicable break, time shared in love is very meaningful and will stay with you both forever, but every good thing must come to an end and you've postponed that point for too long now. TL;DR: Stop getting back together when it doesn't work out.",informal

"The oyster beds were laid off the coast of Porlock Bay in 2013 as part of an initiative to boost employment and ""improve the image of the area"". Now, the farming of the shellfish has taken off, secured the highest quality rating and are due to be sold locally. Roger Hall, from the Porlock Futures Community Interest Company, said it had been a ""brilliantly successful trial"". Using oysters from Morecambe Bay in Lancashire, trials were set up to establish whether the shellfish could be farmed in the seas around Porlock. ""We've proved the oysters not only grow but have got the best Class A classification for cleanliness you can get,"" said Mr Hall.

"The election will determine who will succeed Sepp Blatter, who has been president since 1998. Blatter, 79, and vice-president Michel Platini have both been suspended for 90 days amid corruption allegations, which both men deny. Platini is seeking the next presidency, as is Prince Ali bin al-Hussein. Frenchman Platini, president of European football's governing body Uefa, submitted his candidacy papers earlier this month, but Fifa says it cannot recognise his candidacy while his ban is in place and he cannot campaign. However, Fifa's electoral committee says it may allow him to stand if his suspension ends before the election date. Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain is expected to contest the election. Former Trinidad and Tobago midfielder David Nakhid said he will stand, while ex-Tottenham defender Ramon Vega is considering doing likewise. South Korean Chung Mong-joon, another confirmed candidate, claimed his campaign has been ""sabotaged"" by a six-year ban from Fifa's ethics committee. On Tuesday, the 64-year-old's bid to lift the ban was rejected a Zurich district court. Swiss Blatter is under criminal investigation over claims he made a £1.35m payment to Platini in 2011, as well as allegations he signed a contract ""unfavourable"" to Fifa. Fifa's reform committee also made a number of recommendations for the governing body to make changes to ""improve efficiency, prevent fraud and conflicts of interest and increase transparency in the organisation"". A 12-person panel, chaired by former International Olympic Committee director general Francois Carrard, including officials from the six continental confederations, proposed: More recommendations will be added before being put to the executive committee in December 2015 prior to Fifa's members approving any changes in February 2016.",formal

"It has been waiting on a review of the Russian Proton rocket, which failed on its last outing in May while carrying a Mexican payload. Inmarsat's third Global Xpress platform was due to be the next passenger and was grounded as a consequence. The launch on the Proton is now set for 28 August from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Lift-off will be at 17:44 local time (12:44 BST). Inmarsat is the world's largest mobile satellite services operator. Its principal customer base is the shipping sector, but the company also caters for any groups that need telecommunications away from a fixed line. These include oil and gas installations, the aviation sector, armed forces, aid agencies and NGOs in disaster areas, and TV news crews reporting from trouble zones. Its new £1bn GX network is the biggest commercial UK space project in the process of being rolled out right now. It is designed to incorporate three spacecraft distributed around the globe to give worldwide coverage. Two have already gone up, to relay telecommunications from Asia all the way across to the Americas. The upcoming launch should complete the network over the Pacific, and give customers seamless coverage wherever they are - something that is especially important to the shipping and aviation sectors. Investigators are now confident they understand the loss of May's Proton. The natural vibration in the rocket's third stage loosened bolts that held a turbopump in place for a steering engine. The disruption ultimately broke an oxidizer line and led to the pump shutting down, and the loss of the engine. Measures have been put in place to make sure this cannot happen again. The Proton has had a torrid record of late. Six vehicles and their payloads have been lost in the past five years, and Inmarsat's GX network is roughly a year behind schedule because of all the problems the rocket system has experienced. ""The return to flight is typically the best flight to be on because there is extra caution, extra controls,"" Michele Franci, Inmarsat's Chief Technical Officer, told BBC News. The new satellite is insured, but the company has taken the additional precaution of ordering a fourth platform from manufacturer Boeing. This would be available in mid-2016 should anything go wrong this month. Global Xpress sees Inmarsat take its first, firm step into Ka frequencies to deliver communications. Traditionally, its spacecraft have worked in the L-band. The higher frequency of Ka allows faster throughput connections, giving the new satellites broadband speeds that are 100 times faster than the company's previous generation of spacecraft. ""If there has been any benefit from the delay, it's that it has allowed us to fix network issues that we would have had anyway in this period,"" said Mr Franci ""So, once we go really live at the end of the year, the network will be more stable and more reliable. But we could definitely have done without the delays, that's for sure."" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",formal

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Democratic presidential candidates on Wednesday criticized President Bush's plan to withdraw roughly 30,000 troops from Iraq by next summer, with Sen. Hillary Clinton labeling it ""too little, too late."" Sen. Hillary Clinton listens as Gen. David Petraeus testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee. In an open letter to Bush, Clinton said the troop withdrawal ""is simply too little, too late, and unacceptable to this Congress, and to the American people who have made clear their strong desire to bring our troops home, and end this war."" Bush on Thursday is expected to endorse the recommendations of Gen. David Petraeus that the troop levels in Iraq be lowered to 130,000 by July, down from the ""surge"" level of 160,000. ""As commander in chief, you have the authority and ability to greatly accelerate the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, and to bring so many more troops home so much faster,"" the New York Democrat said. ""I strongly urge you to choose this course of action."" In an interview Wednesday with CNN, one of Clinton's chief rivals for the 2008 nomination, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, said the president is returning to an earlier, failed policy. ""We now are still in the same position as we essentially were in June 2006,"" he said. ""We are in the same levels of violence; we are at the same levels of dysfunctional when it comes to the government in Iraq, and the American people at some point have a right to ask from their leadership in Washington and from the president: When is enough enough?"" Watch '08 Dems weigh in on war in Iraq » . Obama presented a new plan for Iraq on Wednesday afternoon in Clinton, Iowa. It calls for an immediate drawdown of combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month, to be completed by the end of next year, according to excerpts released before his speech. A brigade comprises between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers. Obama recommended a new constitutional convention for Iraq, a new regional diplomatic effort and steps to confront the country's humanitarian crisis. ""Let me be clear: There is no military solution in Iraq, and there never was. The best way to protect our security and to pressure Iraq's leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops,"" Obama said in his speech. Presidential candidate John Edwards, who has been pressing congressional Democrats to take a more confrontational stance against President Bush, called for an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops. In a prepared statement, Edwards, a Democrat from North Carolina, said Obama, Clinton and Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who recently called for a withdrawal to begin by Christmas, have ""a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them, including a filibuster, to force the president to change course."" Edwards also called Obama's plan for troop withdrawal a copy of the president's plan . ""Sen. Obama would withdraw only one to two combat brigades a month between now and the end of next year,"" said Edwards, ""which for the next several months could essentially mimic the president's own plans to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer."" In a statement, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Connecticut, said Wednesday that it was useless to debate tactics when ""the underlying policy is a complete failure."" ""I call on my colleagues to do what needs to be done to end our involvement in this civil war and help restore our national security by clearly and directly declaring that they will not support any Iraq measure without a firm, enforceable deadline tied to funding for the completion of redeployment of troops from Iraq,"" Dodd said. Democrats lack the votes in Congress to force the president to bring the troops home and are seeking a compromise position. Congressional Democratic leaders are meeting with Republican lawmakers, who want a change in war policy but are unwilling to cut funding or set a timeline for withdrawal. Privately, congressional Democrats concede that the next president probably will inherit at least a deployment of 100,000 troops in Iraq. The Democratic presidential candidates, particularly the five in Congress, face pressure from liberal groups such as MoveOn.org demanding that they directly confront the president. Obama said it was unlikely he would vote for any legislation that does not include a definite withdrawal deadline. ""You know, we are going to have to evaluate what's available, but it appears clear to me that the president is not willing to compromise, short of Congress forcing him to accept a shorter timetable, and, absent that, we are essentially engaging in a bunch of symbolic action there,"" Obama told CNN. ""What we need is a clear message from the Congress that it is time for us to change course, and it's time for us to do that,"" he said. E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The confirmation of Michael Mukasey as attorney general was all but assured Friday when two key Democratic senators said they will vote in favor of the nominee despite questions about his views on ""waterboarding"" and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Charles Schumer of New York announced they would support the retired federal judge from New York just hours after the chairman of the Judiciary Committee announced his opposition to the nominee. Feinstein and Schumer are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is scheduled to vote on the Mukasey nomination Tuesday. If all the Republican members of the committee also vote for Mukasey, which is expected, his nomination will go before the full Senate. A leading Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday Mukasey is likely to be confirmed if his nomination passes the Judiciary Committee. Schumer had praised the nomination of Mukasey as a consensus candidate when the president announced Mukasey as his choice to replace former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Gonzales gave up the post in September. ""This is an extremely difficult decision,"" Schumer said. ""When an administration so political, so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge, we are never left with an ideal choice. Judge Mukasey is not my ideal choice. However, Judge Mukasey, whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him, is far better than anyone could expect from this administration."" A number of Democratic senators, however, have said they will oppose Mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called ""waterboarding"" and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Waterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning. Mukasey told senators this week that he finds waterboarding ""repugnant,"" but he could not answer whether the technique amounts to torture. While saying ""serious questions have been raised about Judge Mukasey's views on torture and on separation of powers,"" Feinstein said she would support the nominee because the Justice Department needed fresh leadership. ""First and foremost, Michael Mukasey is not Alberto Gonzales. Rather, he has forged an independent life path as a practitioner of the law and a federal judge in the Southern District of New York. ""I believe that Judge Mukasey is the best we will get and voting him down would only perpetuate acting and recess appointments, allowing the administration to avoid the transparency that confirmation hearings provide and diminish effective oversight by Congress."" Just hours before Feinstein and Schumer announced their decisions, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, announced he would vote against the Mukasey nomination. Watch Sen. Leahy explain why he can't support the Mukasey nomination » . ""No American should need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is torture,"" Leahy said. ""Waterboarding was used at least as long ago as the Spanish Inquisition. We prosecuted Japanese war criminals for waterboarding after World War II. ""I am eager to restore strong leadership and independence to the Department of Justice. I like Michael Mukasey. I wish that I could support his nomination. But I cannot. America needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle -- deeply embedded in our laws and our values -- that no one, not even the president, is above the law."" President Bush demanded the Senate confirm Mukasey during a speech Thursday at the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank. ""In a time of war, it's vital for the president to have a full national security team in place,"" the president said. The president has equated asking Mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the CIA-run interrogation program, whose details are classified. Bush said the program does not violate U.S. bans on torture, but added that Mukasey ""does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy."" But Leahy said ""Judge Mukasey was not asked to evaluate any secret 'facts and circumstances.' "" ""He was asked whether waterboarding is illegal. Our law makes torture illegal, and waterboarding is torture, and it is illegal. It is frankly not dependent on any, quote, 'relevant facts and circumstances of the technique's past or proposed use,' "" he said, quoting from Mukasey's response to senators on the question. Sources with knowledge of the CIA-run interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding. But those sources have said waterboarding was used in the interrogation of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, now facing trial before a military tribunal for planning al Qaeda's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. The practice was used by the Spanish Inquisition, Cambodia's Khmer Rouge and the World War II Japanese military, according to Human Rights Watch. It is specifically banned in U.S. law governing the treatment of prisoners by the U.S. military. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",formal
"I kinda of have issue with putting blame on just one party. Yes, I agree 154.37 (repeating, of course) % that Riot should have had booths (or at least some sort of method blocking the minimap). They offer so many positive benefits that its almost a necessity. Hell, given the chance I'd argue this with Carmac, who is against the idea of booths (just look at any IEM). BUT looking behind you is against the rules that Riot set in place before the tournament began. And rules is rules. You don't see guys running up and down a court in basketball not dribbling the ball because it is easier and faster that way. You don't see American Footballers making horse-collar tackles because its a good place to get a grip - and if they do, they get penalized. For those saying riot is just using frost as a fall guy: Redbeard posted this, and might have been skipped over, in the rulings post: ""In hindsight, the potential visibility of minimap screens for players was a mistake. Despite on-site referees, close monitoring of player cams backstage, and stage design that ensured players would have to turn more than 90 degrees to be able to catch a glimpse of the minimaps, even the possibility of unfair play was simply unacceptable. We’re taking steps to ensure the minimap screens are not visible to players."" tl;dr Riot should have had booths, but at the same time Frost did break the rules",informal
"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Obesity is the No. 1 health crisis in the United States, and the nation could be at risk without immediate action, former President Clinton said at CNN's first Fit Nation Summit. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and former President Clinton lead the discussion at the first Fit Nation Summit. ""We need to do something about it for our children, and for our country, because something like this could easily collapse our nation if we don't act now,"" Clinton said. Clinton and CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, gathered with experts from across the country Wednesday to explore solutions to America's obesity crisis. Two-thirds of adult Americans are overweight or obese; the same is true for one-third of U.S. children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity carries increased risk of myriad health problems, including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and arthritis. Gupta, Clinton and a panel of experts addressed such proposed solutions as healthy school lunches, elimination of trans fats, the need for healthier food in urban communities and the importance of supporting community-based efforts to fight obesity. Watch Gupta explain the solutions proposed at the Fit Nation Summit » . Clinton, who's been tackling the obesity issue over the past few years with his Alliance for a Healthier Generation, stressed the need to help educate people about the importance of a healthy diet and exercising together. Motivating Americans, especially kids, won't be easy, Clinton said. ""They need to be handled with care. Kids need to know it's important, but [fitness] can't be boring,"" he said. ""There's no shame, there's no embarrassment. We have to let them know it's all good, but you have to do it."" Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a strong advocate against trans fats in foods, stressed that the Food and Drug Administration should ban trans fats altogether and stop leaving it up to local and state governments. Trans fats, at one time, thought to be good fat substitutes, over the years have been shown to raise LDL or bad cholesterol in people and lower their HDL, or good cholesterol. ""They're just not good for our health, Jacobson said. However, Dr. Robert Eckel, former president of the American Heart Association, warned, ""Although we support the removal of trans fats, our biggest concern is what they'll be replaced with. We need to think about that, because there will be a substitute."" The panel took questions from an audience of 150 people -- mostly obesity experts or those who work in industries that deal with obesity. Gupta was inspired to launch Fit Nation, an ongoing, multiplatform, grass-roots initiative against obesity. Over the past three years, Gupta and the CNN Medical Unit have crisscrossed the country, asking Americans to take charge of their weight by exercising more and eating healthier. This year, Gupta traveled from Michigan to California asking the public to pledge to add 1 million hours to their collective lives by getting off the couch and exercising. Since he began the tour in April, the campaign has surpassed its goal, with exercise pledges close to four times that amount. Gupta said he hopes that legislators and administrators who can make a difference in policy and perhaps change attitudes about obesity will hear the solutions discussed at the summit. ""I''ve covered a lot of stories on obesity,"" Gupta said. ""There's a battle going on, and we need to win the battle. I've talked to people out there and many are just blasé. ""This is our opportunity to make them care."" E-mail to a friend .",formal
"Alonso's win moved him into third in the standings, 17 points behind leader Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull, who is four ahead of Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen. ""We have a competitive package, especially on Sundays,"" Alonso said. ""We need to make it a little faster on Saturdays. We are working on that but it is looking good."" The supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment Alonso qualified only fifth in Spain but fought through to win after moving up to third on the first lap and then using an aggressive four-stop strategy that allowed him to exploit the Ferrari's race pace. It was his second victory of the year, to follow on from a win in China last month, and he finished second to Raikkonen in Australia, the only other race in which he has not had problems. In Malaysia, he damaged his front wing in a collision with Vettel on lap one and then retired when it broke after he did not come in to change it. In Bahrain, he finished eighth after problems with his DRS overtaking aid. Alonso said: ""We have only had five races in the championship. In these five races, we have nearly two retirements and without this we were maybe leading now a little comfortably. ""So what we need to do is have consistent podium results for the next four or five races and that will bring us a lot of points to put in the pocket."" Alonso had a scare when one of his tyres got a puncture before his final pit stop, but the team were able to bring him in two laps earlier than planned to avoid a problem. ""We decided to play safe after Malaysia, where we were a little bit brave trying to do one extra lap with the front wing broken and we crashed in that lap. ""Here it could have affected the strategy because it was stopping too early, but it was OK and didn't affect the result."" The victory was Alonso's third in his home country, following his 2006 Spanish Grand Prix win for Renault and last year's victory in the European Grand Prix in Valencia. He was cheered by the packed grandstands and afterwards paid tribute to the fans, making a reference to the troubled economic situation in Spain as a result of the Eurozone crisis. ""It is fantastic,"" he said. ""Winning at home is always like you did it for the first time. It is the third time for me but each time is always different, like a new experience. ""The supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment, so I'm happy for them and thanks to them for the support."" Raikkonen finished runner-up to Alonso, his third second place in a row, and said: ""We are here to try to win races and championships. I want to win; the team wants to win. ""It's disappointing to finish second but if anything we gained some points on Sebastian today so something good came out of today. ""It helps if you cannot win to be second but I don't think it is enough in the long run. We have to keep finishing higher up and when we have a bad day try to make the best out of them and try to minimise them."" Vettel finished fourth for the second time this season, beaten to the final podium spot by Ferrari's Felipe Massa. ""I wouldn't talk about frustration,"" said Vettel, who has taken two wins and a third place in the other two races this season. ""We still finished fourth and got some good points, we wanted more but we just didn't have the tyres to fight with the guys in front. We can be happy with fourth.""",formal
"LOS ANGELES, California -- One of the bigger difficulties any first-time buyer faces is purchasing a car that doesn't scream ""first-time"" to friends, relatives and co-workers, or indeed to the buyer each time they step into an ill-chosen purchase. A ""shark"" that races down roads. To break from the boring econobox, here are some of the more sculpted and stylish cars available for about $20,000 that will hold their looks for a long time and give a little bit of joy to a first-time owner. Hyundai Tiburon . If you didn't know already, Tiburon means ""shark"" in Spanish, and it's not hard to see how Hyundai's sporty coupe can stalk the unwary first-time buyer and snare them quickly. Like an instantly recognizable dorsal fin, the Tiburon in its third incarnation is perhaps the purest low-slung sportster that won't bust a first-time buyer's wallet, though it may chew a hole in the seat of their pants as they're pushed back into those tight-hugging bucket seats. The startling Hyundai-designed looks boast a touch of Italian styling uncommon for its bracket. Mazda MazdaSpeed3 . A bona-fide pocket rocket, any first-time buyer can put a fair distance between themselves and the pack in the MazdaSpeed3, part of the Asian carmaker's strategy to wrestle performance compact coupe sales from European carmakers. This one isn't overbearingly dripped in trim or wings, but don't let any youngster tell you it doesn't have what it takes to make their peers jealous. The MazdaSpeed3 will storm from standing to a mile a minute in under six seconds and is said to hit 155 mph. Its secret is torque negation in the low gears -- and perhaps its 263 horses under the hood. Another hidden gem is its seven-speaker Bose stereo. Pontiac G5 GT Coupe . Much like the fantastic Chevy Cobalt SS, its younger sister Pontiac G5 GT boasts highly sprung motoring at a price that appeals to the first-time buyer's wallet. The G5 GT has been tweaked just slightly from its sister SS -- like the difference between Ashlee and Jessica Simpson -- boasting a less horizontal grille and more sculpted valance. Both are reasonably stylish from the back and side and both leaving plenty room for aftermarket add-ons. A new grille entirely, like a Phantom, may just be what you need to set it off against the crowd. The GT's inline-four 2.4-liter 173-hp engine -- 25hp over the base -- drives the front wheels to hit 0-60 mph in 7.5 seconds. Gas mileage is good and customer satisfaction ratings are off the hook. Ford Mustang V6 . A revamped chassis is the key to why Ford's Mustang has become an outstanding product at a price that's hard to beat. A tweak to the iconic lines for last year included a smaller back window and a longer, craggier front end. Some might of course call us heretics for picking a V6 over the famous eight-cylinder included in the GT package but, to be honest, the V6 performs admirably, pushes out 210hp and emits a low-down growl that sounds wonderful. And it's still a Mustang. Civic Coupe . A Civic hatch was my second car (after a very short-lived VW Rabbit). The coupe tested earlier this year brought back fond memories of the Civic's surprisingly roomy front cabin, its enjoyable handling and maneuverability, first-class economy and its sporty elongated hood and swooping back end. Standard features include a 350-watt premium sound system, a touch-screen satellite-navigation system whose screen flips to reveal the CD player, and a slot for a computer memory card. It's also got a funky dash that spectrally lights at night -- what fun. Scion xB . On the heels of its 2004 release, Toyota's hipster Scion brand has remodeled its boxy wonder this year, this time boasting more than a design nod to its parent company's FJ Cruiser. Wide rear pillars, wraparound headlights and bumper define the second-generation variant, which comes dripping with gadgetry inside, as well as leaving plenty of room for after-market customization. This one turns heads while allowing you to pack five adults in relative comfort. Other notable features include a central console that fits in a DVD player alongside a backlit GPS sat-nav system that lights up in any one of 10 colors. Honda Fit . A co-worker bought one of these after crashing her old and very badly beaten up Saturn on a left turn into oncoming traffic. Ouch. So it technically wasn't her first car, but for many buyers, it will be. Energetic, filled with flair and boasting a vertical fold the length of its bonnet, the Fit looks the part as well as being colossally roomy inside for what you expect. You don't get a third row of seats in there but, with the back row folded flat, it almost lends you to believe it can become a camper. Other great touches include an mp3 input jack and reclining rear-seat headrests, while gas mileage is, as expected, very good indeed. E-mail to a friend .",formal

Person A went to Berkeley. You decide to look into Berkeley's programs. You find that person A knows many of the faculty members as they were very active in the department. You submit your application to the person with the project you're most interested in, (person B) but you say is okay if it doesn't work out with them, you wouldn't mind working with someone else.

I don't remember the story well but they either made the lake or made it bigger and the town had to be moved. didnt take down the buildings and once in a while you can see them sticking up a bit out of the water. I think the area use to just be a river. a decent part of the Central Valley use to be a lake because of all of the rivers flowing in. Shaver might be from this too. blocking off the rivers to dry up the valley. Not sure though. this is what it use to be. Tulare Lake. Biggest lake on the west side of the Mississippi river.

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Reggae legend Lucky Dube, one of South Africa's most famous musicians, was killed in an attempted car-jacking as he dropped his children off at a relative's house, his record label said Friday. Reggae star Lucky Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans. Dube, 43, was killed in Johannesburg around 8 p.m. local time Thursday after someone tried to steal his car, Gallo Record Company said in a statement. Police said he was shot. The statement said Dube attempted to escape but died almost instantly from his wounds. Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans, and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend. News of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers, knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days. Callers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris. Gallo Records called the death ""senseless and random,"" and it was not clear whether Dube's attackers knew who he was. South Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered, more than 52,600 people were raped, and nearly 13,600 people were carjacked. ""It's very sad,"" said Mark Sutherland, London bureau chief for Billboard Magazine. ""He's a big loss to the South African music business. (He was) one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists."" Sutherland said Dube was an extremely respected musician who toured extensively around the world. Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York. His record company said Dube leaves ""a great void"" in the music industry after a 25-year career. Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans. Born outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named ""Lucky"" by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies. Dube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music. It was only later that he began recording reggae tracks as a solo singer, but the genre was to dominate and define the remainder of his career. Ivor Haarburger, the chief exectutive of Gallo Music Group, said he was deeply saddened by the loss. ""Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend,"" Haarburger said. ""It's so sad to lose such a great friend and so tragically."" Dube is survived by his wife, Zanele, and his seven children: Bongi, Nonkululeko, Thokozani, Laura, Siyanda, Philani and three-month old Melokuhle. E-mail to a friend .

"NEW DELHI, India (Reuters) -- India has elected its first female president, official results show, in what supporters are calling a boost for the rights of millions of downtrodden women, despite a bitter campaign marked by scandal. Pratibha Patil, 72, is India's first elected female president. Pratibha Patil, the ruling coalition's 72-year-old nominee for the mainly ceremonial post, easily beat opposition-backed challenger and vice president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in a vote by the national parliament and state politicians. ""This a victory of the people,"" Patil told reporters after official results were announced Saturday. ""I am grateful to the people of India and the men and women of India and this is a victory for the principles which our Indian people uphold."" Patil won about two thirds of the electoral college votes. There had never been any doubt she would win, given support from the ruling coalition. The governor of the northwestern desert state of Rajasthan, she emerged on the national stage when the Congress-led coalition and its communist allies failed to agree on a joint candidate. ""This is a very special moment for us women, and men of course, in our country because for the first time we have a woman being elected president of India,"" Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi, India's most powerful politician, said. Supporters hoped Patil's candidacy would help bring issues that plague women in India, like dowry-related violence, into the public spotlight. A woman is murdered, raped or abused every three minutes on average in India. Her presidency also reflects the growing power of some women in India, where an increasing number are taking part in the workforce and in schools and hold senior positions in corporations. After the results, Patil supporters took to the streets, singing and dancing as others lit fire crackers and beat large brass drums. India has had a number of female icons in the past -- most famously Sonia Gandhi's mother-in-law, Indira, who was one of the world's first female prime ministers in 1966. But hope Patil's presidency would spark only positive talk about women's influence in India evaporated when it emerged the bank for women she helped established was closed in 2003 because of bad debts and amid accusations of financial irregularities. The employees' union has taken Patil and others to court, claiming loans meant for poor women were instead given to her brother and other relatives and not returned. She was also accused of trying to shield her brother in a murder inquiry. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has dismissed accusations against her as ""mud-slinging"", said on Saturday her victory was ""a vote against the politics of divisiveness"". ""All the allegations against me are motivated and have already been answered,"" Patil said in a statement last week. Her campaign was marked by other mishaps as well. She managed to offend many minority Muslims, and anger some historians, by saying Indian women first veiled their heads as protection against 16th century Muslim invaders. Then she dismayed modern India by claiming she had experienced a ""divine premonition"" that she was destined for higher office from a long dead spiritual guru. Critics also dug up a comment she was said to have made as Maharashtra's health minister in 1975, saying people with hereditary diseases should be sterilized. E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sniper Lee Boyd Malvo said in a letter to CNN that he is still ""grappling with shame, guilt, remorse and my own healing if that will ever be possible."" And a social worker who has worked extensively with him said he draws self-portraits that often show him with a tear running down his cheek. A self-portrait drawn by sniper Lee Boyd Malvo. Many of his drawings show him with a tear running down his cheek. Malvo, 22, spends 23 hours a day inside his cell at Virginia's toughest prison, a maximum-security compound called Red Onion, not far from the Kentucky border. He's serving a life sentence. According to social worker Carmeta Albarus-Lindo, Malvo is a changed person since he and John Allen Muhammad terrorized the Washington area five years ago this month in attacks that left 10 dead over a 23-day period. ""The most I can do is to continue to be there, because that is his greatest fear -- that, you know, another parental figure would abandon him because that was what he'd been exposed to all his life,"" said Albarus-Lindo, who has spent hundreds of hours with Malvo since his arrest and conviction. Read the letter » . She said one of those ""parental"" figures was Muhammad, who met Malvo in the Caribbean nearly two years before the deadly shooting spree began in 2002. Muhammad became the teenager's surrogate father, convincing him that violence was the only way to correct perceived injustices to African-Americans, Albarus-Lindo said. He ordered Malvo to go to bed each night and to memorize passages from ""The Art of War,"" an ancient Chinese text on battlefield strategy. According to Albarus-Lindo, Malvo was ""brainwashed"" into aiding Muhammad in the murders. However, prosecutors have said Malvo, even at 17, knew what he was doing. ""I thought he was coldblooded,"" said Paul Ebert, commonwealth attorney for Prince William County, Virginia, of the first time he met Malvo. ""He was a person who had chosen a life of crime."" And when a Virginia jury spared Malvo's life, some investigators said they were horrified. ""That was the hardest day of my career,"" said April Carroll of the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco. ""I felt that day we had failed when Malvo was not sentenced to death."" Some of the victims' families said they are content that Malvo did not receive the death penalty. Vicki Buchanan Snyder, whose brother James ""Sonny"" Buchanan was shot in the back while mowing a patch of lawn at a Maryland auto dealership, said she was ""satisfied"" with the jury's verdict. As for Malvo, Albarus-Lindo said he will ""never forgive himself for what has happened."" When she first began seeing him, he still called Muhammad ""Dad."" It took months, she said, before he stopped. In the interim, Albarus-Lindo said, he took college correspondence courses and began to draw. Muhammad is at a Virginia prison called Sussex One. In a DVD made last year inside prison and obtained exclusively by CNN, he said he is ""still fighting"" on death row. He wants to ""correct,"" he said, some ""inaccurate statements"" made by the news media about his relationship with Malvo. He wasn't specific about what he meant. Watch Muhammad on death row » . Muhammad's ex-wife, Mildred, said she believed that she was the real target of the snipers from the beginning. She and her children live in suburban Washington, and she runs a Web site called Afterthetrauma.org, devoted to the victims of domestic abuse. Mildred Muhammad said she feels her ex-husband wanted to kill her as revenge because she was able to gain custody of their three children.

"Reuters is a global information company providing material tailored for professionals in the financial services, media and corporate markets. Its information is trusted and drives decision making across the globe. In October 1851 Paul Julius Reuter, a German-born immigrant, opened an office in the City of London which transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris via the new Calais-Dover cable. 18 months earlier he had used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, a service which operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed. Reuters, as the agency soon became known, eventually extended its service to other European countries. It also expanded the content to include general and economic news from all around the world. In 1865 Reuters was first in Europe with news of President Lincoln's assassination in the United States. As overland telegraph and undersea cable facilities developed, the business expanded beyond Europe to include the Far East in 1872 and South America in 1874. In 1883 Reuters began to use a ""column printer"" to transmit messages electrically to London newspapers and in 1923 pioneered the use of radio to transmit news internationally. In 1927 it brought in the teleprinter to distribute news to London newspapers. Today Reuters has over 16,900 staff in over 94 countries across the globe, and is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, with 196 bureaux serving approximately 131 countries. In 2006 Reuters filed over two and a half million news items, including 656,500 alerts, from 209 countries around the world, published in 18 languages. Although Reuters is best known as the world's largest international multimedia news agency, more than 90% of its revenue derives from its financial services business. Some 370,000 financial market professionals working in the equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, money, commodities and energy markets around the world use Reuters products. The company supplies news -- text, graphics, video and pictures -- to media organizations across the globe. It also provides news to businesses outside the financial services sector, as well as direct to consumers. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"While I don't much support the term noob per se, I think the most useful definition of a player is their ability to understand and work in the team dynamic to push for victory. There are two main lessons a player must learn, and a bunch of secondary ones that stem from that. Lesson 1: Play Well Individually This is mostly the obvious part. If you're playing a sniper, get headshots, deal with counter sniping, and so on. Each class has their own foibles and learning curve. Engineer is probably the best class for the 'rote' aspects of this, as much of their early game strategy basically comes down to building perfectly at an optimal speed, like getting the sentry and dispenser up by the main spawn to cover the courtyard and both forward entries ASAP on round start. Other classes are more implicit, like knowing how to use the maps for scouts, spies, and soldiers. Knowing how to set an effective sticky trap. You may not necessarily be great at a given class, but you migrate out of 'noob' territory in my book when it's clear your play mistakes are incidental rather than systemic. Got killed by a random enemy poking around a corner? Not a noob error. Missed a clutch shot and died in an important firefight? Happens to the best of us. Over-extend into a front line? Probably a noob mistake. Lesson 2: Play Your Team One thing I find really frustrating on many pub servers is that most people never really seem to get the idea of working together as a team. All classes have their strengths and weaknesses, and while you can go far on your own personal skill, the force multiplication of a coordinated effort is so huge that on pubs it is usually more important than skill unless it's entirely lopsided. Obvious things are like picking classes that cover where the team is weak. There's also more subtle stuff, like if you have an engineer building a forward base, help guard the zone for a few seconds if you don't have an immediate priority target to reach. Understanding the dynamics of timing and supporting the moves your allies make is a gigantic step out of noobdom. See an uber? Follow it. Know a spy's getting in position to sap? Try to pull attention. At a higher level of play, you can begin to perform some actions that would normally be somewhat noobish with deeper thought and skill in mind to achieve a bigger goal. For example, you're a scout and can afford to break ahead of your team's push of the fourth point, and the fifth is clear. But the other team is moving as a squad back to the other point. Do you cap or harass? This is a complex question, but there are times when the right answer is to run through their team to try and force a medic kill or at least slow their push enough to get the cap and give the rest of your team spare moments to reload for the fight. tl;dr: A 'noob' is someone who acts without a plan and/or has insufficient skill to credibly execute their plans. You don't have to be amazing to stop being a noob - you just need to be able to present a credible challenge.",informal

"Sarah Sands, 32, killed her 77-year-old neighbour Michael Pleasted weeks after finding out he allegedly abused three boys, the Old Bailey was told. She told police that Mr Pleasted, who had been charged with sexual assaults on two children aged under 13, had been ""asking for trouble"". He was killed in his Canning Town flat on 28 November. Ms Sands denies murder. The court heard how Ms Sands armed herself with a knife after drinking two bottles of wine and a bottle of brandy. The case's prosecutor Jonathan Ree said CCTV footage showed she was in his block of flats for 20 minutes. Mr Pleasted, who was stabbed eight times, had been on bail awaiting trial. Police were also investigating an allegation he had abused a third boy. Ms Sands had befriended the pensioner who was a familiar local figure and ran a bric-a-brac shop from a Mace convenience store, the court heard. She used to visit him at his flat and bring him meals before she became aware of the abuse allegations. After the stabbing, Ms Sands went to the Isle of Dogs, putting the knife and clothes she had been wearing in a carrier bag. Before deciding to hand herself in, she told a family friend: ""I stabbed him"". During a police interview, she said she had tried to help him, while all the while he was abusing young children. She later said in a statement that she denied intending to kill Mr Pleasted or cause him serious bodily harm, claiming she went to confront him and took a knife for protection as she was scared. The trial continues.",formal
"(CNN) -- Football superstar, celebrity, fashion icon, multimillion-dollar heartthrob. Now, David Beckham is headed for the Hollywood Hills as he takes his game to U.S. Major League Soccer. CNN looks at how Bekham fulfilled his dream of playing for Manchester United, and his time playing for England. The world's famous footballer has begun a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy team, and on Friday Beckham will meet the press and reveal his new shirt number. This week, we take an in depth look at the life and times of Beckham, as CNN's very own ""Becks,"" Becky Anderson, sets out to examine what makes the man tick -- as footballer, fashion icon and global phenomenon. It's a long way from the streets of east London to the Hollywood Hills and Becky charts Beckham's incredible rise to football stardom, a journey that has seen his skills grace the greatest stages in world soccer. She goes in pursuit of the current hottest property on the sports/celebrity circuit in the U.S. and along the way explores exactly what's behind the man with the golden boot. CNN will look back at the life of Beckham, the wonderfully talented youngster who fulfilled his dream of playing for Manchester United, his marriage to pop star Victoria, and the trials and tribulations of playing for England. We'll look at the highs (scoring against Greece), the lows (being sent off during the World Cup), the Man. U departure for the Galacticos of Madrid -- and now the Home Depot stadium in L.A. We'll ask how Beckham and his family will adapt to life in Los Angeles -- the people, the places to see and be seen and the celebrity endorsement. Beckham is no stranger to exposure. He has teamed with Reggie Bush in an Adidas commercial, is the face of Motorola, is the face on a PlayStation game and doesn't need fashion tips as he has his own international clothing line. But what does the star couple need to do to become an accepted part of Tinseltown's glitterati? The road to major league football in the U.S.A. is a well-worn route for some of the world's greatest players. We talk to some of the former greats who came before him and examine what impact these overseas stars had on U.S. soccer and look at what is different now. We also get a rare glimpse inside the David Beckham academy in L.A, find out what drives the kids and who are their heroes. The perception that in the U.S.A. soccer is a ""game for girls"" after the teenage years is changing. More and more young kids are choosing the European game over the traditional U.S. sports.

"(1)Commission Decision of 11 December 2001 relating to a proceeding under Article 81 of the EC Treaty (Case COMP/E - 1/37.919 (ex 37.391) - Bank charges for exchanging euro-zone currencies - Germany) (notified under document number C(2001) 3693) (Only the German text is authentic) (2003/25/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation No 17 of 6 February 1962, First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1216/1999(3), and in particular Articles 3 and 15(2) thereof, Having regard to the Commission decision of 1 August 2000 to initiate proceedings in this case, Having given the undertakings and associations of undertakings concerned the opportunity to make known their views on the objections raised by the Commission pursuant to Article 19(1) of Regulation No 17 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2842/98 of 22 December 1998 on the hearing of parties in certain proceedings under Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty(4), Having consulted the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions, Having regard to the final report of the Hearing Officer in this case, Whereas: A. INTRODUCTION (1) This Decision concerning an infringement of Article 81 of the EC Treaty is addressed to the following undertakings: - Commerzbank AG, - Dresdner Bank AG, - Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG, - Deutsche VerkehrsBank AG, - Vereins- und Westbank AG. (2) The banks participating in the meeting of 15 October 1997 at Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG in Frankfurt am Main agreed to a commission of about 3 % for the buying and selling of euro-zone banknotes during the three-year transitional period beginning on 1 January 1999. The purpose was to recover about 90 % of the ""exchange margin"" income after the abolition of the ""spread"" (i.e. buying and selling rates) on 1 January 1999. B. THE RELEVANT PRODUCT AND TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES 1. The relevant product market (3) On 1 January 1999, the euro was introduced as the European single currency. The twelve participating euro-zone countries are: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands and Greece(5). During the transitional period (1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001), the euro existed in different denominations. The national currency units (ATS, BEF/LUF, DEM, ESP, FIM, FRF, IEP, ITL, NLG, PTE and GRD) were sub-units of the euro according to the conversion rates which were irrevocably fixed as from 1 January 1999. (4) The relevant product market is defined as the service of exchanging the ""subunits""(6) of the euro where at least one part of the transaction concerns notes and coins (""in-currency banknotes"")(7). This service - buying and selling foreign euro-zone currencies - was offered mainly by banks and by bureaux de change. The following are typical examples of such exchange transactions: - foreign in-currencies (cash) exchanged to be debited from or credited to an account denominated in euro or in the national in-currency, - foreign in-currencies (cash) exchanged for the national in-currency (cash), and vice versa. (5) Whatever the supply substitutability, demand substitution for the (partly) cash exchange of in-currencies is very limited, if not non-existent. In particular as far as tourism is concerned, customers follow tour operators' and banks' advice to carry only small amounts of cash on them and to use their debit or credit cards abroad. (6) As for other categories of customer such as small businesses which exchange larger amounts of currency to carry out payments in other countries, cross-border bank-to-bank transfers may not present a viable alternative. 2. Trade between Member States (7) The data on volumes of note and coin transactions come from the answers to a questionnaire sent in October and December 1999 to about 240 banks in the euro zone (see recitals 22 to 24). (8) The 1998 selling and buying volumes for note and coin transactions per euro-zone country for all euro-zone currencies are shown in Annex I. The amounts shown are underestimates because not all banks were able to provide data on transaction volumes. Furthermore, not all banks in the euro zone were sent the questionnaire. Also, the questionnaire did not systematically cover bureaux de change operations so that the transaction volumes for this business are not included in the data. (9) For selling, the transaction volume for all euro-zone currencies was about EUR 17,5 billion in 1998. About 35 % of this transaction volume was attributable to the selling of DEM. For buying, the transaction volume was about EUR 24,7 billion. Over 50 % of this transaction volume was attributable to the buying of DEM. The total transaction volume for buying and selling was about EUR 42,2 billion in 1998. Within the euro zone, the DEM was by far the most exchanged (bought and sold) currency (see Annex euro zone). Annex shows that there was considerable exchange of euro-zone currencies in each Member State. C. THE MARKET IN GERMANY 1. The banks (10) Universal banks that engage in a wide range of banking activities dominate the German banking system. At the end of 1998 there were more than 3400 banks with over 45000 branches. (11) Universal banks can be classified into three major groups: - commercial banks (Kreditbanken): This group includes Deutsche Bank, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank (the ""Big Four""), - savings banks and their regional giro institutions (Sparkassen and Landesbanken): This group is made up of 594 savings banks, 12 Landesbanks and DGZ DekaBank Deutsche Kommunalbank, - cooperative banks (Volks- und Raiffeisenbanken) and their central institutions (Zentralbanken): this sector consists of 2256 local cooperative banks and four central banks (DG Bank, SGZ-Bank, WGZ-Bank and GZB-Bank). (12) In addition to the universal banks there is a wide range of specialised banks such as mortgage banks (Hypothekenbanken) and banks with special functions and other financial institutions such as building societies (Bausparkassen). 2. Currency exchange transaction volumes (13) Of the survey sample of 42 banks (see recitals 22 and 23), 35 banks carry out currency exchange transactions. For these 35 banks, the volumes of Community currencies bought and sold per currency in 1998 are shown in Figure 1 below. Figure Volumes of currencies bought and sold in Germany (1998) >PIC FILE= ""L_2003015EN.000301.TIF""> (14) For the currencies shown in Figure 1, the total value of notes bought and sold in 1998 was approximately EUR 2,1 billion, with about twice as much being sold than bought. The buying and selling of ATS represented about 22 % of the value of currencies bought and sold, followed by ITL, FRF, ESP and NLG, which accounted (in descending order) for between about 18 % and 13 % each. The in-currencies represented about 90 % of the value of the EU notes bought and sold(8). D. PROCEDURE 1. The requests for information (15) On 8 February 1999 the Commission addressed requests for information under Article 11 of Regulation No 17 to three German banking associations, namely the Bundesverband deutscher Banken, the Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband and the Zentraler Kreditausschuss. The associations were asked to provide all minutes and/or records of meetings held within the association where questions relating to euro conversion, exchange of in-currencies, as well as costs (to credit institutions) and charges (to customers) were discussed. Also requested were copies of all correspondence exchanged between the association and its members, circulars addressed by the association to its members, and responses of the association to enquiries from its members concerning the abovementioned questions. (16) The Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband responded by letter dated 3 March 1999. The Bundesverband deutscher Banken and the Zentraler Kreditausschuss each responded by letter dated 14 April 1999. (17) On 7 July 1999 the Commission addressed a further request for information under Article 11 of Regulation No 17 to the Bundesverband deutscher Banken asking for clarification concerning a number of meetings devoted to charges for foreign exchange transactions. The Bundesverband deutscher Banken responded by letter dated 29 July 1999. (18) On 6 March 2000 the Commission addressed a further request for information under Article 11 of Regulation No 17 to the Bundesverband deutscher Banken and to the German Bundesbank asking for details of any discussions and/or recommendations on charges and charging structures that had been made in Germany, and more specifically on: - a 3 % charge and a minimum fee of DEM 5, and/or - a 4 % charge and a minimum fee of DEM 3. (19) By letters dated 21 March 2000, the Bundesverband deutscher Banken and the Bundesbank both replied that they had no knowledge of any such discussions and/or recommendations on charges and charging structures. 2. The February and October 1999 inspections (20) Under Article 14(3) of Regulation No 17, inspections were carried out on 16 and 17 February 1999 at two locations in Germany: - Deutsche Bank AG (Frankfurt head office), - Dresdner Bank AG (Frankfurt head office). (21) Under Article 14(3) of Regulation No 17 an inspection was carried out on 20 and 21 October 1999 at a location in the Netherlands: - GWK Bank NV/De Grenswisselkantoren NV (Diemen)(9). 3. Survey of bank charges for exchanging banknotes (22) By letter dated 19 October 1999, the Commission under Article 11 of Regulation No 17 sent a questionnaire to about 240 banks in the euro zone asking them to provide data on bank charges for foreign exchange transactions before and after the introduction of the euro. The addressee banks represent about 80 % of banking turnover in the euro zone. (23) The questionnaire requested data on the buying, selling and reference rates (""official"" rate) for each currency on 15 January 1998 and 15 December 1998, and the charges and charging structure on 15 January 1999. Also requested were the selling and buying volumes (per currency) of transactions carried out in 1998. (24) The questionnaire dated 19 October 1999 was addressed to 42 banks in Germany, including the following addressees of this Decision: - Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG, - Commerzbank AG, - Deutsche VerkehrsBank AG, - Dresdner Bank AG. 4. The statement of objections (25) By letters dated 3 and 10 August 2000, the Commission sent a statement of objections to Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG, Reisebank AG, Dresdner Bank AG, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG, Vereins- und Westbank AG and other banks(10). 5. Replies to the statement of objections and the hearing (26) Following requests from the parties, the Hearing Officer informed the parties of his decision to extend the deadline for responding to the statement of objections (hereinafter called ""SO"") from 3 November to 27 November 2000. (27) Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG and Reisebank AG(11) requested access to all other country-specific files and the complete Dutch file in particular. They claimed this was necessary to safeguard their rights of defence as they suspected that the Dutch National Bank (DNB) had played a leading role in initiating the contacts between GWK Bank and German banks. They believed that the Dutch file included documents proving DNB involvement. (28) In response to this request, the Hearing Officer examined the Dutch file (Case COMP/E-1/37.791) and extracted all documents referring to Germany and other countries. Under cover of a letter dated 12 January 2001, these documents were sent to addressees of the SO, who were invited to submit observations by 24 January 2001. (29) All parties except Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank AG requested a hearing and received an invitation to such a hearing scheduled for 1 and 2 February 2001. All parties except Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank AG attended the hearing. (30) During the hearing the parties present were informed that they would be provided with a copy of an internal note of the Internal market Directorate-General which contained a short analysis of the approximately 700 complaints received by the Commission departments (Internal market and Consumer protection Directorates-General) from Community consumers in relation to bank charges for various payment means and services following the introduction of the euro. (31) By letter dated 26 February 2001, the Hearing Officer sent the abovementioned copy of the internal note of the Internal market Directorate-General to the parties and requested them to submit their observations on the note and on the hearing itself by 14 March 2001. (32) The banks taking the opportunity to comment on the internal note argued that the only reason for complaints was that for the first time customers were able to clearly identify the charges as they were no longer hidden in the difference between the buying rate and the selling rate. Dresdner Bank AG stated that consumers were disappointed as they had wrongly expected no charges at all. (33) Also at the hearing on 1 and 2 February 2001, the parties repeated their request for full access to all parallel country-specific files. By letter dated 6 August 2001 the Hearing Officer denied these requests. Further requests for supplementary access to the other parallel country-specific files were also denied(12). E. DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS 1. The introduction of the euro (34) The Madrid European Council of 15 and 16 December 1995 adopted a timetable for the changeover to the euro. The Madrid Council established the starting date for Stage 3 of Economic and Monetary Union (hereinafter called ""EMU"") as 1 January 1999. For a period of three years from this date, the conversion rates would be irrevocably fixed among the currencies of participating countries (in-currencies) and against the euro(13). (35) From 1 January 1999, and for a three-year transitional period, the euro would exist as a ""virtual"" currency in the euro-zone countries. National banknotes of each euro-zone country would continue to circulate and foreign exchange services for the buying and selling of in-currencies would still be required during this period. However, the ""conversion"" between in-currencies would be carried out at the irrevocably fixed exchange rates, and at no other rates. (36) By 1 February 2002 at the latest, euro banknotes and coins would start to circulate alongside national notes and coins. At most six months later, the national currencies would have been completely replaced by the euro in all participating Member States. (37) The use of the conversion rates was further stipulated in Council Regulation No 1103/97 of 17 June 1997 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro(14). According to Article 4(3) of the Regulation, ""The conversion rates shall be used for conversions either way between the euro unit and the national currency units"". (38) Prior to the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, customers were charged in Germany for the exchange of euro-zone foreign notes and coin (hereinafter called ""exchange of in-currency banknotes"") almost exclusively via a spread(15). The irrevocable fixing of the exchange rates as from 1 January 1999 meant the abolition of the different buying and selling rates, i.e. the spread, as a means of expressing charges for the exchange of in-currency banknotes. (39) Furthermore, the ""exchange rate risk"" cost element that existed prior to the introduction of the euro as a result of the fluctuating exchange rates between currencies disappeared with the fixing of euro-zone currencies' exchange rates on 1 January 1999. (40) While the scenario adopted by the Madrid Council in December 1995 provided the basic framework for the changeover, many practical details relating to technical preparation of the move to Stage 3 remained outstanding. During 1996, the Commission received written comments and queries from associations representing currency users on various aspects of the changeover. With a view to addressing concerns expressed by these associations and to advance technical preparations, the Commission organised on 15 May 1997 a Round Table on practical aspects of the changeover to the euro. The Round Table provided a forum for dialogue among all interested parties, both public and private, and addressed two main sets of issues: the practical arrangements for a smooth changeover to the euro and helping currency users adjust to the euro(16). (41) Under the two main sets of issues, the Round Table discussed a broad range of EMU questions. Among these was a question on the costs of conversion during 1999 to 2001 and during the final changeover. The discussion on this subject mainly concerned the conversion of national currency units to euro units (and vice versa). Regarding the exchange of one participating Member State's banknotes to another during the transitional period, participants argued that this should be chargeable because, ""while exchange rate risk will disappear and thus reduce costs by some 20 %, other costs will remain"". (42) Following the Round Table of 15 May 1997 the Commission set up an Expert Group on Banking Charges for Conversion to the Euro (hereinafter called ""Expert Group""), in parallel with a number of other groups. The Expert Group - comprised of experts drawn from banking, payment systems, enterprises and consumer organisations - met six times in Brussels (between 10 September and 20 November 1997), and received written and oral contributions from a wide range of market associations and institutions. It received assistance also from the Commission and the European Monetary Institute (hereinafter called ""EMI""). (43) The Expert Group's terms of reference were to consider whether banks would be entitled to charge for conversion to the euro, whether they intended to do so, whether any new rules were necessary at Community level and how to ensure transparency of any conversion charges. In its report of 20 November 1997(17) the Expert Group defines ""conversion"" as relating to the process of changing the national currencies of participating Member States into the euro. Conversion thus refers to an arithmetical calculation for quoting national currency units in euro units, and vice versa(18). The report expressly states that it did not deal with charges for bank services(19). (44) The European Banking Federation gave evidence to the Expert Group on 24 September 1997. At this meeting, the Chairman of the Expert Group asked the Federation if it might be possible to draw up a list of specific euro-related services which would be free or be subject to charges per country. By letter dated 3 October 1997, the Federation requested its EMU Committee to provide this information giving a deadline of 10 October 1997 for a response. The Expert Group concluded in its report of 20 November 1997 that ""most banks intended to charge their customers for the exchange of euro area national banknotes during the transitional period, though charges should be less than at present because the exchange rate risk will have been removed. Charges would cover handling, storage, insurance and processing costs, the opportunity cost of holding stocks of banknotes and the risk of accepting counterfeit banknotes."" (45) In its report the Expert Group concludes and recommends, among other things, the following: - ""To encourage 'good practice' relating to conversion without charge, the Group considers that the Commission should recommend the standard of 'good practice' for banks on conversion without charge ... The standard would be advisory rather than binding."", - ""Where banks are entitled to charge for conversion, and decide to do so, the conversion rate must be used (i.e. the irrevocably fixed rate in relation to euro). The Group recommends ... that the use of the conversion rate and any charges should be transparent, and included in the standard of 'good practice'. To reduce the risk that consumers attribute existing charges to the introduction of the euro, the Group recommends ... that the standard should be implemented by banks in advance of 1 January 1999, wherever possible."" (46) On 23 April 1998, the Commission issued a recommendation concerning banking charges for conversion to the euro(20). The recommendation established ""a standard of good practice"" on conversion(21) without charge regarding certain conversion operations where there is a legal requirement not to charge and on certain other conversion operations in order to facilitate the smooth introduction of the euro (Article 2). For example, banks are legally required to make the conversion without charge of incoming payments denominated in the euro unit into the national currency unit during the transitional period. The Commission recommends that banks should also convert without charge comparable outgoing payments. (47) The standard of good practice does not include the exchange of in-currency banknotes without charge. The recommendation does not restrict the banks' freedom in independently defining charges according to each individual bank's commercial policy. (48) The only ""obligation"" that the recommendation imposed on banks with regard to exchange of banknotes and coin of participating Member States related to transparency: ""banks should show clearly the application of the conversion rates in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1103/97, and they should identify separately from the conversion rate any charges of any kind whatever which have been applied"" (Article 3(1)). The recommendation also says that banks should provide clear and transparent information concerning those exchange charges by providing their customers in writing with both general prior (ex ante) information and specific (ex post) information on charges which they respectively propose to apply or have applied (Article 3(2)). (49) The recommendation also provided that banks should inform their customers before 1 January 1999 about whether and to what extent they would implement the recommendation (Article 4(2)). Banks were also recommended to publicise, either individually or in groups, their intention to implement the recommendation (Article 4(3)). (50) On 8 December 1998 the Commission published a report entitled ""Implementation of the Commission recommendation on banking charges for conversion to the euro""(22). The report sets out the information that the Commission had received from European banking associations about the intention of their member banks to implement the recommendation. In July 1998, the Commission asked four banking associations (The European Banking Federation, the European Savings Banks Group, the European Association of Cooperative Banks and the European Mortgage Federation) to report by 1 November 1998 on whether, and to what extent, their member banks were intending to implement the recommendation. Each association's assessment and evidence is published in the annexes to the report. (51) Regarding Germany the report notes, in part, the following: ""Compliance with the recommendation in each participating Member State The Central Credit Committee (ZKA), which represents the whole German credit sector, has agreed to respect the provisions of the recommendation. The Bundesverband deutscher Banken considers that all its members intend to implement the recommendation. This is the case with member banks of the EACB and ESBG in Germany as well. ... Information for customers ... In Germany, where banks have issued a great number of publications on the introduction of the euro, EBF member banks will explain the contents of the recommendation with letters or brochures."" 2. The background in Germany (52) A general presentation was made during the hearing on 1 and 2 February 2001 on the legal and economic background. According to this presentation and Westdeutsche Landesbank, a series of meetings took place between commercial banks and the Bundesbank prior to October 1997. (53) On 8 July 1997, a meeting took place between several commercial banks and the Bundesbank in Frankfurt at which the consequences of the introduction of the euro for the buying and selling of foreign banknotes and coin were discussed(23). (54) Following this meeting, on 22 July 1997 the Bundesbank sent a questionnaire to commercial banks(24) concerning the buying and selling of banknotes in the retail and wholesale markets. The questionnaire asked for data on volumes of banknotes exchanged, the transparency of charges during the transitional phase, the consequences for the retail business if the Bundesbank were to offer a free service to the public, and the consequences for the wholesale business if the Bundesbank were to offer a free banknote repatriation service to the commercial banks. The response of each bank was to be treated confidentially by the Bundesbank. (55) Following the meeting on 8 July 1997 and the Bundesbank questionnaire of 22 July 1997, four commercial banks (Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG, Reisebank AG and Westdeutsche Landesbank) sent a letter dated 25 July 1997 to the Bundesbank stating their view that the spread should be maintained. This was because the necessary information technology changes could not be made in time and also because any adaptation would give rise to additional costs resulting in higher charges to customers(25): ""...The central banks of the participating countries have undertaken, after the fixing of the exchange rates, to exchange euro-zone currencies free of charge. However, from the point of view of the Bundesbank and the regional Landeszentralbanks, there is no interest in taking over the private customer business of banks as a new infrastructure for this purpose would first need to be created. Owing to the planned obligation on the Bundesbank to buy in-currencies free of charge, a rush of consumers to the Landeszentralbanks would be inevitable as the commercial banks, for cost reasons, would refuse to buy currencies without a spread. The turnover in forex business in bank branches in Germany amounts to DEM 16 billion. The turnover in DEM clearing with foreign correspondent banks should be added to this figure. The volume of purchases from customers and repatriation volumes will be estimated on the basis of a separate Bundesbank questionnaire. The practical implementation of the necessary measures has been discussed between the signatories, who are heavily involved in the currency exchange business. The question of charging instead of the current spread (selling/buying rates) was seen as highly problematic. As a result of the discussion, all participants have in principle rejected a change as the resulting costs for IT adaptation would make the exchange of banknotes more expensive, and the public would not appreciate higher charges. Consumers would not understand the introduction of a charge when exchange rates were fixed and central banks purchased in-currencies free of charge. It is also important to note that IT changes cannot be made at such short notice. A survey among our euro-business partners has shown that foreign banks also insist on keeping the spread. A separation between fixed rate plus commission in retail business and keeping the margins in interbank business may be possible for banks with branches as they can directly influence their branches. In the sector of Sparkassen (savings banks) and Genossenschaftsbanken (cooperative banks), such an approach could only be implemented with difficulty as the independent Sparkassen and Genossenschaftsbanken could hardly accept charging their customers fixed rates plus commission while they themselves applied buying/selling rates with their central institutions. For the above reasons, the signatories, as specialists in the currency exchange business, advocate maintaining selling and buying rates and sticking to tried-and-tested procedures to avoid any hitches in the run-up to the introduction of the euro"". (56) During July and August 1997, the commercial banks replied to the abovementioned (recital 54) Bundesbank questionnaire(26). (57) As a follow-up to the informal Ecofin Council meeting on 12 and 13 September 1997 in Luxembourg, a meeting took place on 15 September 1997 between commercial banks and the Bundesbank in Frankfurt. The meeting provided further clarification that charging via a spread (i.e. buying and selling rates) would not be possible after 1 January 1999. Any charges would have to be shown separately: ""The issue of fees, in particular exchange fees, was also addressed. On 1 September 1997, the Landeszentralbanks sent around a questionnaire by letter in order to determine whether the commercial banks would set a fee for the exchange of national euro-zone banknotes or whether they would practice a spread between two exchange rates. In this respect, the Bundesbank stated that charging for the exchange by way of a spread would no longer be possible. A solution would only be possible by way of a fee"". 3. Facts (58) In April 1997 GWK Bank, with its 68 bureaux de change (including 33 at main railway stations and 25 along the border), became concerned at the pricing to be implemented in Germany for the buying and selling of in-currency banknotes following the disappearance of the spread on 1 January 1999. (59) GWK Bank contacted a similar institution in Germany, Reisebank AG (with 59 bureaux de change at big railway stations and border crossings), initially to make them aware that the German Bundesbank might use its network of about 200 offices to provide a free service to the public for the buying of euro-zone banknotes during the transitional period (1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001) as a consequence of the implementation of Article 52 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks (hereinafter called ""ESCB Statute""). This would pose a threat not only to Reisebank AG, but also to the main business of GWK Bank, which was the buying and selling of DEM. (60) GWK Bank urged Reisebank AG to begin discussions with other German banks, in the first instance to try to ensure that the Bundesbank would not provide a free service to consumers via its network of 200 offices. (61) These discussions and contacts led to a meeting at Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG (Frankfurt) on 15 October 1997 where price fixing between several German banks took place. (62) The documentary evidence of the infringement is to be found in the reports of meetings and telephone conversations found during the inspection of 20 and 21 October 1999 at the premises of GWK Bank (Diemen) in the Netherlands. 3.1. Meeting between GWK Bank and Reisebank AG on 29 April 1997 (63) On 29 April 1997, a meeting took place in Frankfurt between GWK Bank and Reisebank AG. According to the minutes of this meeting(27), GWK Bank was surprised at Reisebank AG's lack of information on changes to be expected in the market for the exchange of euro-zone banknotes after 1 January 1999. Reisebank AG was under the impression that the exchange margins and fee structure for the exchange of euro-zone banknotes would be maintained until the introduction of euro cash in 2002: ""Minutes of 29 April 1997 of the meeting with Deutsche Reisebank(28) in Frankfurt concerning the euro problem (dated 2 May 1997). ... The predominant feeling at the discussions was astonishment on the part of GWK that Deutsche Reisebank lacked up-to-date information and astonishment on the part of Deutsche Reisebank at the position taken by the German Bundesbank and [because of ] the other short-term euro problems."" Assumptions by Reisebank The gentlemen of Reisebank AG felt they were prepared for the euro. The development of the ""card-sales"" product, the opening of bureaux de change on Germany's eastern border and the improvement of its market share in the exchange market would provide sufficient compensation for it to be able to face the future with confidence. In this scenario, however, Reisebank AG assumed that the euro problem would not arise until 2002. It expected there would be no changes to the cash exchange markets between 1 January 1999 and 1 July 2002 (or even as from May 1998), because: 1. the current margin structure would be maintained; 2. the current commission structure would be maintained; 3. the current network of exchange locations would remain unchanged. (64) The information provided by GWK Bank to Reisebank AG at the meeting caused both surprise and concern. The main points raised were: - exchange margins would disappear in 1999 and be replaced by a visible charge, - the national central banks (NCBs), under the influence of the European Monetary Institute (EMI), were exerting pressure on the commercial banks to reduce bank charges after 1 January 1999, - the Dutch National Bank had decided that the implementation of Article 52 vis-à-vis Dutch commercial banks would involve a free service for the repatriation of foreign euro-zone banknotes to their country of origin. Other NCBs were considering a free exchange service to the general public, - there were rumours that German commercial banks were prepared to offer a free service for the exchange of euro-zone banknotes from 1 January 1999. (65) On the above points, the meeting minutes state as follows: ""The information passed on by GWK After we provided our information, there was a certain amount of disbelief and fear. We provided the following information. 1. It is most probable that the margin structure will disappear in 1999, which will put pressure on the profit side; in the Netherlands, the banks consider that the margin will be nil and will have to be replaced by a (visible) commission. Public opinion could then turn against this higher commission. 2. The Dutch National Bank has tried (and according to Mr [...]* is still trying) to induce the banks to require a substantially reduced remuneration for exchanging euro-zone cash and it is only because the banks insisted (according to the information provided by GWK) that a slight improvement in the DNB's position is to be observed. We conclude from this that other central banks (under the influence of the EMI) are exerting similar pressure on commercial banks. 3. This (political) pressure has been, together with Article 52, the occasion for an EMI-scale survey of the large commercial banks, in which GWK (because of its specialisation) has been included. 4. The DNB wishes to interpret Article 52 narrowly to mean that the European central banks are obliged to repatriate without charge only excess euro-zone currencies to the participating countries concerned and it does not wish to modify the existing infrastructure of the (retail) exchange business during the relevant period. 5. The DNB has taken this position after having been informed (mainly by GWK) of the problems that are to be expected. 6. GWK and the large banks are exploring the possibility of transforming the current margin- and commission-based remuneration structure into a purely commission-based remuneration as from the beginning of 1999 to avoid having to increase charges in parallel with the highly mediatised introduction of the euro. 7. More specifically, the German Bundesbank and the French and Italian central banks have insisted on a broad interpretation of Article 52 so that the public can enjoy a free service. 8. Rumours are circulating (according to Mr [...]*) that German commercial banks are prepared to offer the public free cash-exchange transactions. 9. This would mean that the changes that are being planned by Deutsche Reisebank could most probably not be implemented."" (66) According to the meeting minutes, Reisebank AG gave no credence to the GWK information. They decided to contact the Bundesbank and commercial banks in order to focus attention on the issues relating to the exchange of euro-zone banknotes after 1 January 1999: ""Deutsche Reisebank's reaction The disbelief about the coming threat was palpable. Partly because of our presence and the conviction with which we expressed our views, this disbelief changed to consternation. Deutsche Reisebank had no knowledge of the EMI survey. We have forwarded them a copy. Action Deutsche Reisebank will contact the Bundesbank and other banking institutions in order to draw attention in Germany also to the problems connected with the conversion of cash into euro. We have agreed to keep each other informed of developments."" (67) The meeting minutes also note similarities in company structure between GWK Bank and Reisebank AG, as well as overlaps in product packages. Both banks made a charge for exchanging cash of around 3,5 % of the transaction value: ""Other information Deutsche Reisebank has approximately 60 bureaux de change (e.g. in railway stations) and approximately 300 associates. There is a clear overlap between product packages, e.g.: Foreign exchange - Cash dispensers - Western Union - Card sales under development. The head office employs about 50 people. Deutsche Reisebank's parent company has outsourced automation to a central cashier. Of their current profits, approximately 80 % are exchange profits and total profits will, after the introduction of the euro, decrease by 40 % (it is not clear if these figures are based on the large or the small euro). The charge levied and the commission amount, as in the case of GWK, to around 3,5 %."" (68) In its reply to the SO, Reisebank AG admits(29) that it was not aware of the major changes in forex business involving in-currencies during the transitional period, and in particular that the buying and selling rates for the exchange of euro-zone currencies had to be abandoned. 3.2. Contact between GWK Bank and Reisebank AG on 5 May 1997 (69) A week after the meeting of 29 April 1997, GWK Bank sent Reisebank AG two documents by fax dated 5 May 1997(30). (70) The first document was a copy of the completed ""Questionnaire to commercial banks and bureaux de change"" which had been submitted to the central bank(31). This was an EMI questionnaire on the implementation of Article 52 of the ESCB Statute (exchange at par value of euro-zone banknotes between 1999 and 2002). The questionnaire had been sent by the EMI to the NCBs requesting information on the annual volume of banknote exchange business, means of banknote repatriation, buying and selling volumes of euro-zone currencies, seasonal variations, existing spreads and commissions, and breakdown of cost components. The NCBs, according to selection criteria chosen by each NCB, sent out the EMI questionnaire to a sample of national banks and bureaux de change. (71) The questionnaire includes a section entitled ""You are invited to make comments and suggestions on the exchange of euro area banknotes on separate sheets of paper, if you so wish"". With the aim of maintaining total income after 1 January 1999, GWK Bank proposed a single handling fee of 3,8 % for the exchange of all euro-zone currencies: ""The total income from a normal euro area currency exchange transaction is about 3,8 %. To maintain the service to the public for the exchange of circulating euro zone currencies, it is necessary to have a compensating commission. Income from a normal euro-zone currency exchange transaction (NLG 350 x 3,8 %) = NLG 13,30 Total costs of a normal euro-zone currency exchange transaction = NLG 11,60. There will be no decrease in costs for our institution after 1 January 1999 and from a euro point of view it is not feasible to maintain different commissions for each euro-zone currency. We therefore propose a handling fee of 3,8 % on a normal (without any discount) euro-zone currency exchange transaction. A figure of less than 3,8 % would be too low, particularly for euro-zone currencies with a relatively low turnover (euro-zone currencies other than DEM, BEF and FRF). Low turnovers result in additional interest losses and relatively higher back-offices expenses. The Dutch National Bank has appended to the questionnaire additional comments on our constitution. A copy of our comments is obtainable from the DNB."" (72) The second document sent by GWK Bank to Reisebank AG contains the detailed supplementary comments of GWK Bank in the EMI questionnaire. This document explains that, to maintain a total exchange income of 2,4 % for all euro-zone currencies, and taking into account the loss of exchange margin income after 1 January 1999 as well as discounts for special groups and clients, an increased commission of 3,8 % would be required(32): ""Retail exchange transactions .... The income as a percentage of turnover (2,5 %) is lower than the exchange rate margins in the list of exchange rates for banknotes and the commission rates would suggest. >TABLE> .... Acceptable commission rate after 1 January 1999 From a social point of view, it is desirable that the service to the public for the exchange of circulating EU currencies be maintained at current levels during the period 1 January 1999 to 1 July 2002. As a result, an increased commission will have to be charged to compensate for the loss of the margin. For GWK, a 3,8 % commission charge on the equivalent of an ordinary exchange transaction will suffice. Discounts for special groups and clients conducting large transactions (including coupon cashing, see also p. 2) will ensure a total exchange income of 2,4 % (3,8 % - 1,38 %) from the entire EU currency turnover. The 3,8 % results in a charge to the consumer which is comparable to the charge for a current, average exchange transaction in EU currencies (exchange rate margin for banknotes plus commission), as further specified below (Annex 2 contains an extensive list of figures). >TABLE> A percentage less than 3,8 is too low, particularly for EU currencies with relatively low turnover (EU currencies other than DEM, BEF and FRF). Low turnovers result in greater loss of interest and relatively higher back-office expenses (counting, storage, transportation and transaction costs, etc.). From a 'euro' point of view, it is not feasible to maintain different commissions for the individual EU currencies."" (73) GWK Bank(33) and Reisebank AG confirmed that GWK Bank sent the above-mentioned documents. According to them, the proposal for a 3,8 % charge was merely a statement made in response to the EMI questionnaire. The EMI itself disseminated the results of the questionnaire. (74) The Commission notes that neither the EMI questionnaire nor the EMI results of the questionnaire addressed bank charges for the exchange of euro-zone banknotes. The EMI drafted a questionnaire which included a request for information on the annual volume of banknote exchange business, means of banknote repatriation, buying and selling volumes of euro-zone currencies, seasonal variations, existing spreads and commissions, and a breakdown of cost components. The purpose was to gather information on the implementation by commercial banks of Article 52 of the ESCB Statute (i.e. the repatriation free of charge of banks' foreign euro-zone banknotes to their country of origin). (75) The EMI prepared a report dated 23 April 1997 entitled ""Exchange at par value of euro area banknotes: Assessment of the results of the questionnaire to commercial banks"". The report was based on the answers to the questionnaire received by the NCBs from banks and bureaux de change and reflected the situation in 1996. The EMI questionnaire covered 14 Member States and responses were received from approximately 150 commercial banks and 40 bureaux de change. The EMI eight-page report contains aggregated data and does not discuss bank charges for the exchange of euro-zone currencies. The report was not published but the EMI Council agreed to release the assessment of the results to the European Banking Federation and the European Savings Banks Group(34). 3.3. Meeting on 11 August 1997 between Reisebank AG, Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG, GWK Bank and Landeszentralbank Hessen (76) On 11 August 1997 a meeting took place in Frankfurt between Reisebank AG, Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG, Landeszentralbank Hessen and GWK Bank(35). The purpose of the meeting was to clarify the situation regarding the exchange of euro-zone notes and coin during the transitional period: ""Report on talks between Reisebank, Landeszentralbank, Deutsche Verkehrsbank and GWK held on 11 August 1997 at the head office of Reisebank AG in Frankfurt, Germany >TABLE> Opening remarks Mr [...]* welcomed everyone to the meeting. He pointed out that there were still many uncertainties with regard to the foreign exchange market for the period 1 January 1999 to 1 July 2002 and that one of the reasons for this meeting was to clarify the situation. After his brief introduction, he handed the floor to Mr [...]*, who was present in his capacity as Reisebank AG's expert on the euro."" (77) The legal representative of Reisebank AG made it clear that commercial banks would be allowed to charge for the exchange of euro-zone currencies during the transitional period but that the exchange margin (i.e. buying and selling rates) would cease to exist after 1 January 1999: ""Mr [...]* In Mr [...]'s* opinion, most members of the EMI held the following two points of view: 1. Commercial banks would be allowed to charge clients for handling exchange operations in euro-zone currencies. 2. Changing circulating euro-zone currencies into euros would have to be free of charge to the customer for the first half of 2002. Point 1 The commercial banks would be able to charge for handling exchange transactions. The form this payment would take would not be laid down by the EMI. It could take the form of a fixed commission, a percentage commission or even the current exchange margin, which could vary from currency to currency (combinations were also possible). Mr [...]* pointed out to Mr [...]* that after 1 January 1999 changing euro-zone currencies would in fact be like changing a single currency, but in different forms, and that consequently price differentiation between euro-zone currencies was not a straightforward matter. As Mr [...]* saw it, price differentiation was only possible in the case of different cost prices. There were no demonstrable, significant differences in cost price between the different euro-zone currencies and it was therefore unlikely that the present exchange margin structure would be preserved. .... Point 2 If euro-zone currencies must be converted into euros free of charge between 1 January 2002 to 1 July 2002, this would mean that as of 1 January 2002 GWK would no longer earn any profit from changing foreign euro-zone currencies. Hitherto we had assumed that only circulating guilders would be converted into euros free of charge."" (78) At the meeting, the Landeszentralbank Hessen explained that, according to Article 52 of the ESCB Statute, the Bundesbank was obliged to purchase foreign euro-zone notes and coin from the banks and the public free of charge. The Bundesbank had carried out a survey of various banks to establish the number of transactions to be expected (recital 54): ""Landeszentralbank The Bundesbank wished to interpret Article 52 as follows: The central bank was under an obligation to buy foreign euro-zone currencies from banks and the public free of charge (at par was thus taken to mean free of charge, as it was by the Dutch central bank). The bank would make alterations to (invest in) the present 180 (this number would fall) branches (Landeszentralbanks) so that it would actually be able to provide the service to the public. To establish how many transactions to expect, the Bundesbank had carried out a survey among various banks. Mr [...]* stated that the Bundesbank was not happy with the obligation under Article 52."" (79) This information that the Bundesbank and Landeszentralbanks might offer a free service to the public on a widespread basis caused alarm at GWK Bank. It urged Reisebank AG to reach a consensus with other German banks on the need to charge in order to avoid loss of profits from the exchange of euro-zone currencies during the transitional period: ""Follow-up action After Mr [...]* and Mr [...]* had left, we reminded Deutsche Verkehrsbank and Reisebank of their duty to gather accurate information about the German exchange market as quickly as possible in order to alert the Bundesbank, and other banks too, to the possible loss of profits which would result from providing exchange services free of charge. If, before the Bundesbank took its final decision, a consensus could be reached between the commercial banks on the need to charge for the service and if the Bundesbank could be convinced of the impossibility of the task before it, it might be possible to avert the threat to Reisebank. Mr [...]* reacted to this by saying that this was a problem in Germany because there was no consensus at all between the banks nor could one be expected. It seemed that Mr [...]* would not make any attempt to reach a consensus anyway."" (80) GWK Bank was alarmed that, if the Bundesbank offered a free service on a widespread basis, then the German commercial banks might follow suit with low or no charges. There was a risk that the market for the exchange of euro-zone banknotes would shift from the Netherlands to Germany. There would be pressure on the Dutch banks to decrease charges accordingly: ""Conclusions The developments in Germany were very alarming. The Bundesbank was going to intervene on the exchange market by providing services free of charge, which could easily have a knock-on effect on the level of charges levied by commercial banks, while the institution most closely concerned (Reisebank AG) could be expected to do little about it. The threat was also very considerable for the Dutch exchange market. 1. If the public was charged a reasonable amount in the Netherlands, there was a risk that the exchange market would shift from the Netherlands to Germany (or Austria etc.). 2. Low (or no) charges by commercial banks abroad would pave the way for a fall in charges in the Netherlands (with considerable help from the media). 3. The EMI could easily decide to opt for the Bundesbank's explanation, which would mean that the DNB would also be forced to introduce free exchange services and the consensus reached on the Dutch exchange market would again be up in the air. The above development indicates that GWK must introduce as quickly as possible a high exchange rate commission in order to establish a new price balance on the Dutch market, before pressure from the EMI and DNB upsets the consensus reached."" 3.4. Telephone conversation between GWK Bank and Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG on 29 September 1997 (81) A telephone conversation took place between Mr [...]* (GWK Bank) and Mr [...]* (Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG) on 29 September 1997. Apparently, Mr [...]* had not received the report of the meeting on 11 August 1997 and wanted to know about developments concerning Article 52 of the ESCB Statute(36). A record of the telephone conversation reads as follows: ""Record of (telephone) conversation with Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG, 29 September 1997 >TABLE> Reason Mr [...]* of Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG had somehow obtained the telephone number of Mr [...]*. >TABLE> Mr [...]* had evidently not received a report on this meeting. He was looking for someone in the Netherlands who might know about developments regarding Article 52 and was looking for ways of doing something about this article in the international sphere."" (82) The Commission notes that Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG at this point took the view that the exchange margins (i.e. buying and selling rates) should be replaced by a commission. This was contrary to the letter sent on 25 July 1997 by Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG, Westdeutsche Landesbank and Reisebank AG to the Landeszentralbank Hessen arguing in favour of buying and selling rates being maintained after 1 January 1999 (recital 55). The record of the telephone conversation continues as follows: ""Assessment Contrary to the letter Mr [...]* had sent to Mr [...]* (Landeszentralbank) about Article 52, Mr [...]* now took the view that exchange margins should disappear in Germany and be replaced by a commission. His greatest concern was that no consultations had taken place on this development between the German banks and that only Commerzbank AG and Westdeutsche Landesbank were sharing their thoughts on this problem. Four other German banks had pulled out. In Mr []'s* opinion, this had been imposed at Board level."" (83) The record of the telephone conversation notes that Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG made the following invitation: ""Specific invitation Mr [...]* was attempting to get Commerzbank, Westdeutsche Landesbank, Verkehrsbank, Reisebank, and Landeszentralbank (Mr [...]*) round the table during the week of 6 October 1997 to solve the problem. He specifically wanted GWK to be represented at the meeting. I assured him that I was in theory quite willing to attend this meeting with Mr [...]*."" 3.5. Meeting at Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG on 15 October 1997 (84) By telefax dated 2 October 1997 entitled ""Consequences of EMU for the currency business"", Mr [...]* (Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG) invited representatives of SEB Bank AG (former BfG Bank AG), Commerzbank AG, Dresdner Bank AG, GWK Bank, Hamburgische Landesbank, Landesbank Hessen Thüringen, Landeszentralbank Hessen, Reisebank AG and Westdeutsche Landesbank to a meeting on 15 October(37). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the state of play and possible measures. (85) The meeting took place as planned on 15 October 1997 at Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG (Frankfurt)(38). (86) The GWK Bank minutes of the meeting are entitled ""Pricing of euro currencies between 1 January 1999 and 1 July 2002"". Several topics were addressed including: - whether banks could charge for the exchange of euro-zone banknotes during the transitional period, - whether exchange margins (i.e. buying and selling rates) could be maintained after 1 January 1999, - whether different commissions could be used for exchanging different euro-zone banknotes, - the calculation method for conversion between different euro-zone currencies, - buying and selling rates in the interbank (wholesale) banknote trade. (87) The Commission notes that the meeting rapidly clarified that banks would be allowed to charge customers for the exchange of euro-zone banknotes and that charges must be shown in an explicit and transparent manner. The meeting minutes state as follows: ""Record of talks with Deutsche Verkehrsbank, 15 October 1997 Re: Pricing of euro currencies between 1 January 1999 and 1 July 2002 Opening remarks Mr [...]* welcomed everyone to the meeting. The banks present at this meeting represented between 70 % and 80 % of the German retail exchange market. Mr [...]* summarised the position of the Bundesbank and the EMI concerning the pricing of euro-zone currencies in the period from 1 January 1999 to (at the latest) 1 July 2002. Full agreement had not been reached within the EMI on the question of the retail exchange of circulating euro-zone currencies. The following point was clear, however: Banks would be allowed to pass on the costs they incurred in changing euro-zone currencies to the public. Passing on these charges must be done in a transparent manner."" (88) The Commission notes that the meeting also quickly agreed that the exchange margins (i.e. buying and selling rates) would disappear after 1 January 1999. The participants decided to inform the Bundesbank that they would carry out the exchange of euro-zone banknotes at the fixed exchange rates and charge an explicit commission. The minutes record the following: ""Oral communications Mr [...]* read out correspondence between himself and the Bundesbank from which it was possible to infer that, in the interests of transparency, current exchange margins would have to be abolished. The oral explanation of this was very clear. Nowhere, however, was keeping the margin to offset costs explicitly rejected in writing. In the view of those present who had already looked into the matter more closely, the loss of the exchange rate margin could not be passed on to the retail trade. Conviction Following a remarkably short discussion, all of those present were convinced that the exchange rate margin on euro-zone currencies was going to disappear and that both the value of the money changed and the commission charged would have to be visible. This conclusion would be set out in a protocol to the Bundesbank. The following points would be made: exchange transactions involving the euro-zone currencies will be carried out at fixed prices, to which a commission will be added. Although Mr [...]* shared the meeting's opinion, there was little more he could do. In the absence of written instructions from the Bundesbank, Mr [...]* could not do anything in-house to adapt the computer systems to the new charging structure. Not everyone had this problem (e.g. the Bayerische Landesbank's preparations for replacing the margin with a commission charge were already well advanced) but there was general dissatisfaction with the lack of clarity in the Bundesbank's written statement."" (89) The Commission notes that the meeting participants also discussed whether the existing system of different exchange margins per currency (i.e. different buying and selling rates per currency) should be transposed into a system whereby the existing exchange margins would be expressed as explicit percentage commissions. As complete consensus was not reached concerning the use of a single percentage commission charge for all currencies or different percentage commissions per currency, the participants decided to report to the Bundesbank that each bank would decide this for itself. However, the banks set themselves the common target of replacing the exchange margins by percentage commission(s) such as to recover 90 % of the exchange margin income. This would amount to an overall commission of about 3 %. The minutes mention the following: ""Differentiation in pricing between euro-zone currencies The present pricing policy on the German exchange market was more or less the same for all banks. This meant, for example, that the Austrian schilling was bought and sold cheaply while the Italian lira was very expensive. Commerzbank's Mr [...]* felt that this price difference between the various euro-zone currencies must be allowed to remain. He argued that, as current margins could be seen as a result of market mechanisms, this price fixing could be copied over into a differentiated charging structure. On this point Mr [...]* (Bayerische Landesbank) said that the differentiation between currencies could only be justified because there were differing levels of exchange risk involved. This argument would no longer work after 1 January 1999 when all euro-zone currencies had to be seen as denominations of the euro. Mr [...]* added here that it was not so much that the market mechanism had influenced current margin policy, but rather that this policy was the result of a tacit agreement on exchange rates. The EMI survey quoted by Mr [...]*, which stated that the German banking system's costs would fall by only 10 % with the introduction into circulation of the euro, showed that the price fixing on the exchange market was not caused by prices. This also indicated an oligopoly rather than a 'polypoly'. Accordingly, the replacement of the current tacit differentiated-margin agreement by a tacit differentiated-commission agreement need not lead to major upheavals or loss of profits. Mr [...]* was in full agreement with this. In the absence of a complete consensus at the meeting on whether a single commission fee or a commission fee for each currency should be introduced, the following would be reported to the Bundesbank: each of the banks present will decide for itself the form to be taken by its future charging structure. The banks present at the meeting expressed the intention of replacing their present income from margins with income from commission fees up to a level of approximately 90 %. According to the banks, this would amount to a global commission of approximately 3 %"". (90) The minutes note that the banks discussed the question of the quotation of the direct or indirect rate of exchange when converting between different euro-zone currencies(39), particularly within the context of modifying existing computer systems: ""Compulsory calculating rules The EMI had stated that for establishing the value in German marks of an amount in guilders only one calculating method would produce the correct answer. This meant that the present calculating method used by computer systems would have to be completely reworked (the rate for the guilder against the German mark could no longer be worked out once the rules were applied). Several of those present were aware of these calculating rules, but had not considered the consequences for retail exchange operations. Mr [...]* pointed out that it might be a good idea to do the same as the Belgian banks and inform the EMI that for the retail trade such a vast adaptation of computer systems for a period of only three years should be openly rejected, since the results of the various calculations for normal exchange transactions showed no difference. Hasty note-taking on the part of those present seemed to imply that this problem too had been taken on board."" (91) With regard to the wholesale interbank trade in banknotes, the minutes note that the participants agreed to maintain fixed buying and selling rates to avoid changes to computer systems. Professional traders were well aware of the charges being paid via the different buying and selling rates: ""Interbank trade For interbank trade the exchange margins for currency in circulation should disappear. For trade in circulating currency, however, the banks at the meeting wanted to retain the current practice of using exchange margins. In this way the systems would not need to be adapted (for a three-year period) and there would be no problem if a bank outside the euro-zone needed circulating euro-zone currencies. Mr [...]* (Landeszentralbank), who was following the meeting by phone, stated that according to his assessment it was unlikely that there would be binding legislation for interbank trade in circulating currencies. The following comment would be made to the Bundesbank: For interbank trade in circulating currencies, euro-zone currencies should be bought and sold at fixed buying and selling prices. The difference between the buying and the selling price would be the commission. Mr [...]* observed that the wording was not really very well chosen since this argument had been rejected in the case of the retail trade and there was therefore no reason why it should be accepted in the case of the banks. A better idea would therefore be to include a reference to the fact that transparency within professional trading did not need to be further increased, since the parties involved were well aware of the margins being paid. However, the chosen wording was kept."" (92) The meeting minutes indicate that Deutsche Bank AG was considering a free service to customers for the exchange of euro-zone banknotes. This was seen as much more of threat to the agreed position of the participants for a commission fee of about 3 % (to achieve 90 % exchange margin income recovery) than any free service offered by the Landeszentralbanks: ""Deutsche Bank spoils the party In the course of the meeting it was suggested that Deutsche Bank could spoil things by allowing exchange operations to go ahead free of charge. The commercial banks present at the meeting considered this to be a much more serious threat than the provision of services free of charge by the Landeszentralbanks (which were not equipped for it). This could undermine the position agreed at the meeting on a commission fee of approximately 3 % (90 % of present income). Mr [...]* pointed out that this would in any case create a new situation, even though, in his view, it would be a long time before exchange activities would be carried out for nothing. Others took a firmer line and said that if, for political reasons, exchange operations were going to have to be carried out at zero tariff, they would withdraw exchange services for euro-zone currencies."" (93) The meeting minutes record that the participants were not in favour of introducing the new charging system before 1 January 1999: ""Early introduction The banks were not aiming for the introduction of the new charging structure before 1 January 1999: 1. as much profit as possible would have to be generated in 1998 (the idea of maintaining exchange margins until 1 January 1999, but charging a higher commission, was also felt to be inadvisable). After 1 January 1999 profits could fall sharply under outside pressure (Bundesbank, EMI, Deutsche Bank, the media), so the banks should grab what they could; 2. a possible reduction in turnover as a result of introducing the new charging structure in 1998 was therefore viewed as undesirable; 3. none of the banks was too obviously dependent on the exchange product, so developments after 1 January 1999 would not be life threatening; 4. the short time still remaining between then and 1 January 1999 was already felt to be tight for adapting all systems to the new charging structure."" (94) Mr [...]* (Commerzbank AG) wrote the official meeting minutes entitled ""Meeting of banknote dealers""(40). These minutes were faxed on 17 October 1997 by Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG to the meeting participants(41). The theme of the meeting is given as structure/price-setting for buying and selling banknotes during the transitional period. Both the private customer (retail) and interbank (wholesale) buying and selling of banknotes were discussed. (95) With regard to the retail business, the minutes note that there was consensus on the use of fixed exchange rates for in-currencies (i.e. no buying and selling rates) with charges/fees to be calculated as a percentage commission. The calculation method for converting between in-currencies would be decided by each bank individually: ""Meeting of banknote dealers in Frankfurt on 15 October 1997 Held at Deutsche Verkehrsbank Participants: see annex Minutes Concerning rating/pricing in forex business in phase 3a (1 January 1999 to 1 January 2002) of EMU, consensus was reached on the following points: 1. Private customer business - For private customers there will be a fixed exchange rate for in-currencies and the charges/fees will be calculated separately. - Charges/fees will be calculated as a percentage amount of the exchange value. - The decision whether the calculation will be done using the direct or indirect rate of exchange is to be taken individually by the banks"". (96) The Commission notes that the official and GWK Bank minutes of the meeting correspond to the extent that the customer charges would be in a percentage form. The official minutes do not mention a charge of about 3 %. However, during the hearing on 1 and 2 February 2001, Bayerische Landesbank stated that its representative at the meeting of 15 October 1997 (Mr [...]*) recalled that: ""some representatives of individual banks mentioned some figures, and these were somewhere between 2 % and 4 %"". However, Mr [...]* ""could not recall the 3 %"". (97) With regard to the wholesale (interbank) banknote business, the minutes note that the banks agreed to maintain buying and selling rates: ""2. Interbank trade In interbank trade all in-currencies will be traded with buying and selling prices. These prices are the result of the conversion of the commission. The quotation of the indirect rate of exchange will become general usage as of 1.2.2002. Until that date both quotation methods are to be tolerated. Reasons for the buying and selling quotation In the interbank trade, where the usage has always been set by the participating banks, trading has always been done via buying and selling rates. This should not be changed as - we do not want to make any distinction in the way of quotation between euro-zone currencies and so-called out-currencies, - we do not want to distinguish between contracting parties inside and outside the euro zone, and last but not least as - a change in the present usage would only apply for a limited time period. 3. Next meeting, if needed, at Commerzbank, Frankfurt. Frankfurt, 15 October 1997 [...]* Annex"" F. LEGAL ASSESSMENT 1. Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty (98) Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty prohibits as incompatible with the common market all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market, and in particular those which directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions, limit or control production, markets, technical development or investment, or share markets or sources of supply. 2. Agreements (99) An agreement can be said to exist when the parties adhere to a common plan which limits or is likely to limit their individual commercial conduct by determining the lines of their mutual action or abstention from action in the market. It does not have to be made in writing; no formalities are necessary, and no contractual sanctions or enforcement measures are required. The fact of agreement may be express or implicit in the behaviour of the parties. (100) According to the established case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and of the Court of First Instance, there can be said to be an agreement within the meaning of Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty when the parties have expressed their joint intention to conduct themselves on the market in a specific way(42). (101) The concept of an agreement within the meaning of Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty, as interpreted by the case law, centres around the existence of concurrence of wills between at least two parties, the form in which it is manifested being unimportant so long as it constitutes the faithful expression of the parties' intention(43). An agreement for the purposes of Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty may also fall well short of the certainty required for the enforcement of a commercial contract. Its exact terms may never be expressed: the fact of agreement may have to be inferred from all the circumstances. 3. The nature of the infringement 3.1. The agreement (102) The banks participating in the meeting of 15 October 1997 at Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG in Frankfurt agreed to implement a global commission of about 3 % for the buying and selling of euro-zone banknotes during the three-year transitional period beginning on 1 January 1999. The purpose was to recover about 90 % of the exchange margin income after the abolition of the spread on 1 January 1999(44). (103) At the meeting of 15 October 1997, the participants discussed whether the existing system of different exchange margins per currency (i.e. different buying and selling rates per currency) should be transposed into a system whereby the existing exchange margins would be expressed as explicit percentage commissions. As complete consensus was not reached concerning the use of a single percentage commission charge for all currencies or differentiated percentage commissions per currency, the participants decided to report to the Bundesbank that (recital 89): ""Each of the banks present will decide for itself the form to be taken by its future charging structure."" (104) However, there was agreement that the percentage commission(s) would be set with the purpose of recovering about 90 % of the exchange margin income, meaning an overall or average commission of about 3 % for the buying and selling of different euro-zone banknotes (recital 89): ""The banks present at the meeting expressed the intention of replacing their present income from margins with income from commission fees up to a level of approximately 90 %. According to the banks, this would amount to a global commission of approximately 3 %."" (105) The agreement was again referred to at the meeting of 15 October 1997. The banks were concerned that their agreement would be put in jeopardy if, as seemed likely, Deutsche Bank AG introduced a free service (recital 92): ""In the course of the meeting it was suggested that the Deutsche Bank could spoil things by allowing exchange operations to go ahead free of charge. The commercial banks present at the meeting considered this to be a much more serious threat than the provision of services free of charge by the Landeszentralbanks (which were not equipped for it). This could undermine the position agreed at the meeting on a commission fee of approximately 3 % (90 % of present income)."" (106) Mr [...]* (Commerzbank AG) wrote the official meeting minutes entitled ""Meeting of banknote dealers"". The Commission notes that the official minutes and GWK Bank minutes of the meeting correspond to the extent that there was consensus on the use of fixed exchange rates for in-currencies (i.e. no buying and selling rates) after 1 January 1999, with charges/fees to be calculated as a percentage commission (recitals 94 and 95): ""1. Private customer business - For private customers there will be a fixed exchange rate for in-currencies and the charges/fees will be calculated separately. - Charges/fees will be calculated as a percentage amount of the exchange value."" (107) The official minutes are less descriptive than the GWK Bank minutes and do not mention specific figures. However Bayerische Landesbank and Commerzbank acknowledge that some bank representatives at the meeting expressed their ideas about possible future charges lying between 2 % and 4 %(45). At the hearing on 1 and 2 February 2001, Bayerische Landesbank stated that its representative at the meeting of 15 October 1997 (Mr [...]*) recalled that ""some representatives of individual banks mentioned some figures, and these were somewhere between 2 and 4 %"". However, Mr [...]* ""could not recall the 3 %."" (108) The background to the agreement of 15 October 1997 is as follows. In early 1997, GWK Bank became concerned that the German Bundesbank might use its network of about 200 offices to provide a free service to the public for the buying and selling of banknotes during the transitional period (1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001). GWK Bank became concerned that if a free service were to be offered on a widespread basis by the Bundesbank and the Landeszentralbanks, then the German commercial banks might follow with low or no charges (recital 79). (109) This prospect was alarming to GWK Bank since a large part of its turnover came from the exchange of in-currencies and the DEM in particular. There was a risk that the market for the exchange of euro-zone banknotes would shift from the Netherlands to Germany and/or there would be pressure on the Dutch banks to decrease charges accordingly (recital 80). (110) In April 1997, GWK Bank contacted a similar institution in Germany, Reisebank AG, and urged them to begin discussions with other German banks, in the first instance to try to ensure that the German Bundesbank and the Landeszentralbanks would not provide a free service to consumers via their network of offices (recital 63 to 67). (111) These discussions and contacts led to a meeting which took place at Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG (Frankfurt) on 15 October 1997 where several German banks agreed, inter alia, to implement a charge of about 3 % for the buying and selling of euro-zone banknotes during the three-year transitional period with the purpose of recovering about 90 % of the exchange margin income (recitals 85 to 93). 3.2. The parties' arguments and the Commission's replies - Arguments of the parties in relation to the interpretation of the facts (112) The parties challenge the Commission's interpretation of the facts and deny that the discussions between the banks concerning charging structures and amounts for the exchange of in-currencies during the transitional period amount to an ""agreement"" falling within the scope of Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty. (113) Several banks argue that, since the difference between the buying and selling rates can be calculated as a percentage charge, it was a logical step that participants in the meeting of 15 October 1997 agreed to express the exchange margin as a visible percentage commission after 1 January 1999. This was not a competition-restricting agreement but arose out of the legal necessity to display charges in an explicit and transparent manner with the disappearance of the spread(46)(47). Landesbank Hessen Thüringen admits having entered into an agreement on the charging structure for the transitional period at the meeting of 15 October 1997. As however there were hardly any alternatives to calculating the charge other than in a percentage form, this agreement on a common charging structure only marginally influenced the freedom of the banks to determine their own pricing policy(48). - Commission's reply (114) The transparent and explicit display of charges does not require any standardisation of prices, charging structures or other service concepts in the banking sector. Each bank must independently decide its commercial policy with regard to charging. If a customer bank charge is to be implemented at all, then the charging policy - including charging structure - must be determined independently by each bank. (115) It was not a natural or logical step that each bank would individually have transposed the exchange margin into a percentage commission. Indeed, it seems that Deutsche Bank was initially considering a free service. In any case, the issue is not what may or may not be the most economically rational charging structure, but whether there was an agreement between banks on the charging structure. (116) In the present case, there was an explicit agreement between banks on an overall commission of about 3 % with the aim of achieving about 90 % income recovery after the abolition of the spread on 1 January 1999. - Arguments of the parties to the effect that no agreement was reached (117) Several banks argue that no agreement on a percentage charge of about 3 % was reached(49). Some banks also argue that there was no agreement to recover about 90 % of income nor was the figure of 90 % of the costs mentioned as the calculation basis for the new charges after the introduction of the euro(50). - Commission's reply (118) The question arises as to the credibility of the GWK Bank meeting minutes of 15 October 1997. The official minutes and GWK Bank minutes of the meeting correspond to the extent that there was consensus on the use of fixed exchange rates for in-currencies (i.e. no buying and selling rates) after 1 January 1999, with charges/fees to be calculated as a percentage commission. Westdeutsche Landesbank notes that only one point of the alleged infringement, the fixing of a charging structure, is included in the official minutes of the meeting produced by Mr [...]*(51). (119) Indeed, Bayerische Landesbank and Commerzbank AG acknowledge that some bank representatives at the meeting expressed opinions about possible future charges lying between 2 % and 4 %(52). Commerzbank AG states that some participants at the meeting mentioned that 90 % income recovery would lead to a charge of 2 % to 4 %, or an average commission of 3 %. At the hearing on 1 and 2 February 2001, Bayerische Landesbank stated that its representative at the meeting of 15 October 1997 (Mr [...]*) recalled that ""some representatives of individual banks mentioned some figures, and these were somewhere between 2 and 4 %"". However, Mr [...]* ""could not recall the 3 %"". This shows that the GWK Bank minutes, written within a day of the meeting, are a credible and complete record of the 15 October 1997 meeting. (120) The Commission considers on the basis of the documentary evidence that the banks participating in the meeting of 15 October 1997 agreed to introduce an overall commission of about 3 % (to achieve 90 % income recovery) after 1 January 1999. - Arguments of the parties against early introduction (121) The banks also argue that fixing charges in 1997 would have made no sense because of the long period of 14 months before the introduction of the euro combined with all the economic uncertainties that could arise in such a time period(53). The banks argue that they fixed their charges independently in late 1998(54). - Commission's reply (122) The argument that it would have been premature for the banks to agree on charging structures and charges in October 1997 is contradicted by the banks themselves. The letter sent by four commercial banks (Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG, Reisebank AG and Westdeutsche Landesbank) to the Bundesbank on 25 July 1997 states their view that the exchange margin (i.e. buying and selling rates for in-currencies) should be maintained because, amongst other reasons, the necessary information technology (IT) changes could not be made in time for 1 January 1999 (recital 55): ""The question of charging instead of the current spread (selling/buying rates) was seen as highly problematic. As a result of the discussion, all participants have in principle rejected a change as the resulting costs for IT adaptation would make the exchange of banknotes more expensive, and the public would not appreciate higher charges. Consumers would not understand the introduction of a charge when exchange rates were fixed and central banks purchased in-currencies free of charge. It is also important to note that IT changes cannot be made at such short notice."" (123) The GWK Bank meeting minutes of 15 October 1997 also mention that the time remaining for adapting information technology systems to the new charging structure was short (recital 93): ""4. The short time still remaining between then and 1 January 1999 was already felt to be tight for adapting all systems to the new charging structure."" (124) The conclusion to be drawn from the above is that the price-fixing agreement of 15 October 1997 was most opportune and timely for the banks. - Arguments of the parties concerning the different charges (125) The banks claim that the banks present at the meeting of 15 October 1997 apply different charges ranging from 3 % to 4 %. Only 2 banks actually apply a 3 % charge(55). - Commission's reply (126) Firstly, it should be noted that the finding of the existence, content and object of an agreement infringing Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty and described in the SO was based on specific documentary evidence and not on parallel pricing behaviour in the market. (127) Secondly, since the agreement was to introduce an overall commission of about 3 % aimed at achieving about 90 % income recovery, it is not to be expected that all banks would have identical percentage commissions. The agreement eliminated or, at the very least, substantially reduced uncertainty as to the eventual conduct to be expected of each other on the market with regard to bank charges for the buying and selling of in-currency banknotes. The banks themselves admit that charges of 2 % to 4 % were discussed. However, following the introduction of the euro, none of the parties introduced a commission of less than 3 % (recitals 147 and 148). 4. Restriction of competition (128) The banks participating in the meeting of 15 October 1997 agreed to an overall commission of about 3 % with the aim of achieving about 90 % income recovery after the abolition of the spread on 1 January 1999. This agreement had both the object and effect of restricting competition in the Community. 4.1. Object of the agreement (129) Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty expressly mentions as restrictive of competition agreements between undertakings and decisions by associations of undertakings which directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions. In the present case, the direct fixing of prices is the object of the agreement. (130) Faced with the disappearance of the exchange margin (i.e. buying and selling rates) income after 1 January 1999, the object of the agreement concluded by the banks present at the meeting of 15 October 1997 was to fix the participating banks' commissions for the buying and selling of in-currency banknotes at about 3 % with the aim of achieving about 90 % income recovery after the abolition of the spread on 1 January 1999. (131) Therefore, it must be concluded that the agreement had as its object a harmonisation of banks' future pricing policies and the alignment of prices in the buying and selling of in-currency banknotes. (132) It follows from the above that the agreement concluded between the banks present at the meeting of 15 October 1997 is caught by Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty in that it directly fixes the way of charging for the exchange of in-currency banknotes (i.e. a percentage commission) and the level of charges in the form of a target price. 4.2. The parties' arguments and the Commission's replies - Arguments of the parties concerning the interpretation of Article 52 of the ESCB Statute (133) The parties argue that their discussions were held to address considerable regulatory uncertainty concerning the implementation of Article 52 of the ESCB Statute, particularly as regards whether or not the German Bundesbank would offer a free forex service to the public. - The Commission's reply (134) In 1997, the German Bundesbank had discussions with German commercial banks principally concerning implementation of Article 52 of the ESCB Statute. A meeting took place on 8 July 1997 between the commercial banks and the Bundesbank at which the consequences of the introduction of the euro for the exchange of banknotes was discussed. Following this meeting, the Bundesbank on 22 July 1997 sent a questionnaire to commercial banks concerning the buying and selling of banknotes in the retail and wholesale markets. The questionnaire asked for data on volumes of banknotes exchanged, the transparency of charges during the transitional phase, the consequences on the retail business if the Bundesbank were to offer a free service to the public, and the consequences for the wholesale business if the Bundesbank were to offer a free banknote repatriation service to the commercial banks. The response of each bank was to be treated confidentially by the Bundesbank. Also as a consequence of the 8 July 1997 meeting, on 25 July 1997 four commercial banks (Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG, Reisebank AG and Westdeutsche Landesbank) sent a letter to the Bundesbank expressing their view that the exchange margin (i.e. buying and selling rates for in-currencies) should be maintained, in part, because the necessary IT changes could not be made in time and because any adaptation would give rise to additional costs giving rise to higher charges. A meeting took place on 15 September 1997 between commercial banks and the Bundesbank, which clarified that charging via the exchange margin (i.e. buying and selling rates) would not be possible after 1 January 1999. Any charges would have to be shown separately (recitals 53 to 57). (135) As is clear from the above, the discussions between the Bundesbank and commercial banks concerned the application of Article 52 as well as the abolition of the buying and selling rates on 1 January 1999. The meetings did not encompass collective discussions on bank charges for the exchange of euro-zone banknotes after 1 January 1999. - Arguments of the parties to the effect that the Commission was the initiator of the discussions (136) According to the parties the Commission was the initiator of the discussions and contacts between the banks. The starting point was the Round Table on 15 May 1997 organised by the Commission and dealing with practical aspects of the transition to the euro(56). The banks argue that the reason for the meeting of 15 October 1997 is to be found in the regulatory uncertainties and as a consequence of the initiatives of the European Commission and discussions with the German Bundesbank. - The Commission's reply (137) The Commission organised the Round Table of 15 May 1997 on practical aspects of the changeover to the euro to address concerns expressed by various associations and to advance technical preparations. The Round Table provided a forum for dialogue among all interested parties, both public and private, and addressed two main sets of issues: the practical arrangements for a smooth changeover to the euro and ways of helping currency users adjust to the euro. The Expert Group report of 20 November 1997 expressly states that it did not deal with charges for bank services(57) (recitals 40 to 43). - Arguments of the parties on the question of the admissibility of charges (138) According to the parties, their discussions were also held to address the question as to whether or not it would be permissible for the commercial banks to charge for the exchange of banknotes by way of spreads. - The Commission's reply (139) As early as 1995 it was known that the exchange rates would be irrevocably fixed and that only those fixed rates should be used. This is clearly and explicitly stated in the Presidency conclusions of the Madrid European Council of 15 and 16 December 1995 on the scenario for the changeover to the single currency. Article 4(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97, which has been directly applicable law in all Member States since 20 June 1997, states that ""The conversion rates shall be used for conversions either way between the euro unit and the national currency units"" (recitals 34 to 37). The direct consequence of this is that the use of spreads would not be permissible, and that any charges should be explicitly and transparently shown. All this is also clearly stated in the document setting the terms of reference of the Expert Group on Banking Charges for Conversion to the euro and in the final report of this Expert Group (recital 45). (140) In any case, prior to the meeting of 15 October 1997, a meeting took place (on 15 September 1997) between commercial banks and the Bundesbank which clarified that charging via the exchange margin (i.e. buying and selling rates) would not be possible after 1 January 1999 (recital 57). - Arguments of the parties concerning the invitation fax (141) Several banks claim that, as can be seen from the agenda attached to the invitation fax, the meeting of 15 October 1997 was focused on questions of interbank trade - where pricing was mentioned - as well as on IT issues(58). It is for this reason that the representatives present at the meeting were either from the department dealing with the buying and selling of notes in interbank trade or from the IT department. The private customer department, being the only one with decision-making power concerning the setting of forex charges for private customers, was not represented(59). - The Commission's reply (142) Even the official minutes of the meeting produced by Mr [...]* record that discussions took place on pricing for both the private customer business and interbank trade (recitals 94 to 97). It seems therefore that the banks' representatives were competent to discuss pricing for both retail and wholesale aspects of the banknote exchange business. The Commission considers on the basis of the documentary evidence that the banks participating in the meeting of 15 October 1997 agreed to introduce a global commission for private customers of about 3 % (to achieve 90 % income recovery) after 1 January 1999. (143) With regard to computer (IT) systems, the Commerzbank AG representative explained during the hearing that the retail and wholesale information technology systems are interlinked (if not the same computer program). This means that the pricing/charging systems for both the retail and wholesale business would need to be known prior to any adaptation of the IT systems. Indeed, for private customers, the official minutes indicate that during the three-year transitional period beginning on 1 January 1999 the parties agreed that ""Charges/fees will be calculated as a percentage amount of the exchange value"" (recital 95). With regard to the interbank trade, the parties opted to keep buying and selling rates. 4.3. Implementation of the agreement (144) In order to conclude that Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty applies, there is no need to consider the actual effects upon competition of an agreement once it is established that the agreement had the object of restricting competition. (145) In the present case, there was an agreement between banks on a global commission of about 3 % with the aim of achieving about 90 % income recovery after the abolition of the spread on 1 January 1999. (146) The Commission considers that, having concluded that the agreement was to directly fix the level of charges, there is no need to demonstrate any effect. (147) >TABLE> (148) >TABLE> >TABLE> 5. Effect on trade between Member States 5.1. Currency exchange (149) The infringement at issue concerns a service which is cross border in nature and, for that reason alone, likely to affect trade between Member States. As shown above, there is a large volume of euro-zone currencies exchanged in each Member State (recitals 7 to 9). (150) Selling and buying of foreign currencies within the euro zone are operations concerning essentially consumers, and in particular tourists (both Community and non-Community) who wish to make payments within the euro zone. Payments made by consumers with currencies other than those of their country of origin constitute transactions which affect intra-Community trade. (151) It should be noted that, if consumers buy foreign currencies in their home countries, the bank selling the currencies must first have imported the bank notes. If, on the other hand, consumers buy currencies in the countries of destination with foreign cash, the selling bank must export (or repatriate) the foreign cash to the country of origin. For each bank within the euro zone, there is never a perfect balance at a given time between the volumes of foreign currencies bought from, and sold to, the public. (152) The import and export of euro-zone currencies by the banks are commercial operations that directly affect intra-Community trade. 5.2. The parties' arguments and the Commission's replies - Arguments of the parties concerning the effect on trade between Member States (153) At the hearing(60) the banks argued that the German case was a purely national case thus not having any effect on trade between Member States. The exchange of foreign currencies was a local service, provided on different national markets. Despite being present at the meeting of 15 October 1997, GWK Bank was not active on the German market just as the German banks were not active on the Dutch market. - The Commission's reply (154) The Court of Justice has consistently held that, in order that an agreement between undertakings may affect trade between Member States, it must be possible to foresee with a sufficient degree of probability on the basis of a set of objective factors of law or of fact that it may have an influence, direct or indirect, actual or potential, on the pattern of trade between Member States, such as might prejudice the realisation of the aim of a single market between Member States(61). Accordingly, the Court has held that the effect on intra-Community trade is normally the result of a combination of several factors which, taken separately, are not necessarily decisive(62). It is also settled case law that it is enough to establish that an agreement is capable of having an effect on trade between Member States(63). (155) The Commission has described in the statement of objections and the present Decision (see recitals 149 to 152) several factors which have been taken into account when concluding that the agreement has an effect on trade between Member States. Following the case-law of the Court of Justice, the Commission holds that in this case the effect on trade is a combination of several factors, which taken as a whole, show that there is an effect on trade. (156) In the present case, however, particular attention should be paid to the special nature of the service and the product concerned. As noted above, the service is already cross-border in nature. This stems from the fact that the products concerned are the currencies of other Community Member States, which are exchanged in large volumes in each Member State. - Arguments of the parties concerning the lack of a market definition (157) The banks claim that the Commission has failed to define the geographic market and has therefore made an incorrect assessment of the effect on trade. - The Commission's reply (158) The Commission contends that a definition of the geographic market is not decisive in this case. This is due to the fact that the documentary evidence proves that the parties committed an infringement whose object and effect was to restrict competition. The infringement was also by its nature liable to affect trade between Member States. This conclusion is in line with the Court of First Instance rulings in European Night Services and Volkswagen AG(64), in which the Court held that there is an obligation on the Commission to define the market in a decision applying Article 85 (now Article 81) of the EC Treaty where it is impossible, without such a definition, to determine whether the agreement, decision by an association of undertakings or concerted practice at issue is liable to affect trade between Member States and has as its object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market. (159) The fact that the agreement on charges for the exchange of in-currencies concerns mainly Germany and the Dutch regions bordering on Germany does not preclude an effect on trade between Member States. The Court of Justice has ruled in a number of cases that behaviour restricting competition and extending over the whole territory of a Member State by its very nature has the effect of reinforcing the compartmentalisation of markets on a national basis, thereby holding up the economic interpenetration which the Treaty is designed to bring about(65). (160) In particular, the relevant product has been defined as the service of exchanging in-currencies where at least one part of the transaction concerns notes. The banks have to buy and sell banknotes on the international wholesale markets as a direct consequence of national demand for foreign currency. The Court of Justice has held in Stichting Sigarettenindustrie(66) that an agreement concluded between undertakings established in one Member State and covering only the market of that state affects trade between Member States if it concerns, even partly, a product imported from another Member State. G. ADDRESSEES OF THE DECISION (161) It is clearly established by the facts that Commerzbank AG and Dresdner Bank AG have directly participated in the infringement. (162) The question of appropriate addressees arises only in relation to: - Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG / Vereins- und Westbank AG, - Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank / Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG / Reisebank AG. (163) At the time of the meeting of 15 October 1997 the majority shareholder in Vereins- und Westbank AG was the then Bayerische Vereinsbank AG. Bayerische Vereinsbank AG and Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank AG merged on 1 September 1998 to form Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG. This merger made Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG the major shareholder in Vereins- und Westbank AG. (164) Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG is the second biggest banking group in Germany and considers itself to be a ""bank of the regions"" in which Vereins- und Westbank AG has an individual identity as ""bank of the region of Northern Germany"". (165) Although the invitation fax for the incriminating meeting of 15 October 1997 was sent only to the then Bayerische Vereinsbank AG, no employee of the then Bayerische Vereinsbank AG participated in the meeting. (166) The recipient of the invitation fax for the meeting of 15 October 1997 in the then Bayerische Vereinsbank AG showed it to his superior, who decided that participation was not necessary. The fax recipient however passed the invitation on to a colleague at Vereins- und Westbank AG as he was of the opinion, in contrast to his superior, that it might be possible to obtain some useful information at the meeting. (167) Vereins- und Westbank AG was not invited to the meeting, but nonetheless one of its employees participated and also represented(67) the then Bayerische Vereinsbank AG(68). (168) As a result both Vereins- und Westbank AG and Bayerische Vereinsbank AG were represented at the meeting of 15 October 1997 through the employee of Vereins- und Westbank AG. (169) The reply to the SO of Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG/Vereins- und Westbank AG states that Vereins- und Westbank AG was not bound by the policy of Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG concerning the fixing of charges for the exchange of euro-zone bank notes(69). This shows that both banks operated independently on the market and that Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG did not influence Vereins- und Westbank AG's decision on charges. (170) In the light of the above the Decision is therefore addressed to Vereins- und Westbank AG in its own right and to Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG as the legal successor to the former Bayerische Vereinsbank AG. (171) Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank AG has a 67 % shareholding in Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG. Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG owns all the shares in Reisebank AG with three members of the managing board of Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG as the sole members of the supervisory board of Reisebank AG. Reisebank AG is the only company within the Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank AG group that is active exclusively in the retail forex business(70). Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG at all times exercised decisive influence over its subsidiary by participating in meetings and in discussions with other banks (see recitals 58 to 97). Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG was at all times fully informed and aware of all the discussions between banks concerning charges for the exchange of euro-zone banknotes. According to the case law of the Court of Justice, the decisive criterion in deciding if Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty can be applied between a parent company and a subsidiary is whether or not the subsidiary was able to determine its market behaviour independently of the parent company(71). In the present case, Reisebank AG enjoyed no real autonomy in determining its own course of action vis-à-vis Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG. Reisebank was therefore not capable of infringing Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty independently of Deutsche Verkehrsbank. (172) In the light of the above, this Decision is therefore addressed to Deutsche VerkehrsBank AG as the parent company of Reisebank AG(72). H. DURATION OF THE INFRINGEMENT (173) Commerzbank AG, Dresdner Bank AG, Deutsche VerkehrsBank AG, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG and Vereins- und Westbank AG concluded the agreement infringing Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty in October 1997. The agreement was concluded for the duration of the ""transitional"" period 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001. (174) In the light of the above, the duration of infringement established for all addressees of this Decision is from 15 October 1997 to the present time. I. REMEDIES 1. Article 3 of Regulation No 17 (175) Where the Commission finds that there is an infringement of Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty, it may require the undertakings concerned to bring such infringement to an end in accordance with Article 3 of Council Regulation No 17(73). (176) In the present case, the agreement, whose object was to fix (a) the way of charging for the exchange of in-currency banknotes (i.e. a percentage commission) and (b) a target price level of about 3 % (to achieve 90 % exchange margin income recovery), was concluded for a future three-year period beginning on 1 January 1999 and ending on 31 December 2001. (177) Therefore, the Commission requires the undertakings to which the present Decision is addressed to henceforth refrain from any agreement, concerted practice or decisions of associations which may have the same or similar object or effect as the agreement which is the subject of this Decision. 2. Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17 2.1. General considerations (178) Under Article 15(2) of Council Regulation No 17, the Commission may by decision impose upon undertakings or associations of undertakings fines from one thousand to one million euro, or a sum in excess thereof not exceeding 10 % of the turnover in the preceding business year of each of the undertakings and associations of undertakings participating in the infringement where, either intentionally or negligently, they infringe Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty. (179) In fixing the amount of any fine the Commission must have regard to all relevant circumstances and particularly the gravity and duration of the infringement, which are the two criteria explicitly referred to in Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17. (180) The Commission follows the methodology explained in its guidelines of 14 January 1998 on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17 (hereinafter called ""guidelines on fines"")(74). (181) The role played by each undertaking party to the infringement will be assessed on an individual basis. In particular, the Commission will reflect in the fine imposed any aggravating or attenuating circumstances and will apply, where appropriate, the notice on the non-imposition or reduction of fines in cartel cases (hereinafter called ""leniency notice"")(75). 2.2. Basic amount of the fines (182) In order to determine the amount of the fines, the Commission calculates a basic amount that will be increased to take account of aggravating circumstances, or reduced to take account of attenuating circumstances. The basic amount is determined according to the gravity and duration of the infringement. 2.2.1. Gravity (183) In its assessment of the gravity of the infringement, the Commission takes account of its nature, its actual impact on the market, where this can be measured, and the size of the relevant geographic market. (184) In this case the agreement had the object of fixing (a) the way of charging for the exchange of in-currency banknotes (i.e. a percentage commission) and (b) the level of charges in the form of a target price (to achieve 90 % exchange margin income recovery) for the exchange of in-currency banknotes. Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty expressly prohibits both direct and indirect fixing of prices or other trading conditions. By its nature, the infringement is a very serious violation of Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty. (185) The agreement was implemented by Commerzbank AG, Dresdner Bank AG, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG, Vereins- und Westbank AG and Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG (recitals 147 and 148). (186) However, the infringement produced its effects within a limited part of the common market, namely in Germany, where the agreement covered the whole country, and in the Dutch regions bordering on Germany. (187) Given that the infringement by its nature is a very serious violation of Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty but limited in its effect to Germany and the Dutch regions bordering on Germany, the Commission on balance concludes that the agreement concerned falls within the category of a serious infringement of the Community competition rules. (188) Within the category of serious infringements, the proposed scale of likely fines makes it possible to apply differential treatment to undertakings in order to take account of the effective economic capacity of the offenders to cause significant damage to competition and to set the fine at a level which ensures that it has sufficient deterrent effect. This exercise seems particularly necessary where, as in the present case, there is considerable disparity in the size of the undertakings participating in the infringement. (189) For this purpose the undertakings concerned can in principle be divided into two categories according to their size and their relative importance in the relevant market. The comparison is made on the basis of the income information for the last business year for which audited results are available. (190) Into the first category fall Commerzbank AG, Dresdner Bank AG, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG and Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG. Vereins- und Westbank AG falls into the second category. (191) >TABLE> (192) In order to ensure that the fine has a sufficient deterrent effect, the Commission will determine whether any further adjustment of the starting point is needed for any undertaking. (193) In the case of Commerzbank AG, Dresdner Bank AG and Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG, the Commission considers that the appropriate starting point for a fine resulting from the criterion of the relative importance in the relevant market requires further upward adjustment to take account of their size and their overall resources. (194) On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission considers that, in the case of Commerzbank AG, Dresdner Bank AG and Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG, the need for deterrence requires that the starting point of its fine determined under recital 191 should be increased by EUR 10 million to EUR 20 million. 2.2.2. Duration (195) As mentioned earlier, the Commission considers the duration of the infringement of Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty for all addressees of this Decision to be from 15 October 1997 until the present time (recitals 173 and 174). The starting amounts of the fines determined for gravity (recital 191) are therefore increased by 40 % for each of the undertakings. (196) >TABLE> 2.3. Individual fines (197) In setting the fine for each company, the Commission is obliged to assess any aggravating or attenuating circumstances on an individual basis and to apply, as appropriate, the leniency notice. (198) In the present case there are no aggravating or attenuating circumstances. 2.4. Amount of the fines imposed in the present proceedings (199) >TABLE> HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Commerzbank AG, Dresdner Bank AG, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG, Deutsche Verkehrsbank AG and Vereins- und Westbank AG have infringed Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty by participating in an agreement whose object was to fix (a) the way of charging for the exchange of in-currency banknotes (i.e. a percentage commission) and (b) a target price level of about 3 % (to achieve 90 % exchange margin income recovery) during the transitional period beginning on 1 January 1999. Article 2 The undertakings named in Article 1 shall put an end to the infringement. They shall henceforward refrain in relation to their activities from any agreements or concerted practices which may have the same or a similar object or effect as the infringement. Article 3 >TABLE> Article 4 The fines imposed by Article 3 shall be paid within three months of the date of notification of this Decision to the following account: Account No: 642-0029000-95 Code IBAN: BE76 6420 0290 0095 Code SWIFT: BBVABEBB of the European Commission with: Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) SA Avenue des Arts/Kunstlaan, 43 B - 1040 Brussels. After expiry of that period, interest shall be payable at the interest rate applied by the European Central Bank to its main refinancing operations on the first working day of the month in which this decision is adopted, plus 3,5 percentage points. Article 5 This decision is addressed to: 1. Commerzbank AG Kaiserplatz D - 60261 Frankfurt am Main; 2. Dresdner Bank AG Jürgen-Ponto-Platz 1 D - 60329 Frankfurt am Main; 3. Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG Am Tucherpark 16 D - 80538 München; 4. Deutsche VerkehrsBank AG Friedrich-Ebert-Anlage 2-14 D - 60325 Frankfurt am Main; 5. Vereins- und Westbank AG Alter Wall 22 D - 20454 Hamburg. This decision shall be enforceable pursuant to Article 256 of the EC Treaty. Done at Brussels, 11 December 2001.",formal
"Our part of the country has long been a two-party affair to a greater extent than anywhere else in the country, so a straightforward device pointing this way and then that was almost invariably quite good enough to do the job. But what, I ask myself, would we need to visualise the infinite variety of 2015? The best idea I have managed to come up with so far goes like this. Imagine you suspend a needle from a thread above a table on which you position magnets of varying strengths and political colours in a circle. They symbolise the interactions between the parties in each constituency. Lower the needle towards the centre of the table and see which way it points. [Don't worry, BBC graphics designers, I'm not seriously thinking of doing this. Not yet at least!] But the important point here is that the composition of the different magnets and their respective strengths would be very different from one constituency to another. In this era of multi-party politics, every single seat is more or less a law unto itself. Take for example two of our key local marginals, Dudley North and Solihull. In the Black Country seat, Labour are defending a majority of just 649. In 2010 their closest challengers were the Conservatives. This time, though, with nine seats on the local council its is UKIP who are breathing down Labour's neck. Solihull is another key Conservative target. The Liberal Democrats had a majority over them of just 175 last time round. But since then, the Green Party has established itself as a real force in the town, thanks to a potent combination of green belt and housing issues. Extreme examples though they may be, these two constituencies reinforce the point that whether or not UKIP or the Greens succeed in winning seats themselves, or even come close to doing so, they will undoubtedly have significant and differing impacts on the established parties from one seat to another. Like a collection of by-elections perhaps? That may be overstating it. But I am becoming increasingly convinced that this election offers us regional and local broadcasters a unique opportunity to explore the local dynamics of individual seats and to explain the possibility that in the shake-out of seats between the biggest parties it is not unreasonable to envisage gains and losses in both directions. And what does this tell us about those headline national poll ratings pointing to a hung Parliament, in which the two biggest parties in lock step with each other followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats and then the Greens? Or, about those ""percentage swing to win or lose"" statistics which have been calculated in a predominantly two-party environment? All it tells us is how little they tell us. ""Never assume"" said the recently-departed doyen of cricket commentators Richie Benaud. In an election as unpredictable as this, maybe the assumptions about a hung Parliament are themselves suspect. Maybe the answer lies not in the macro but in the micro. In this contest so full of unexpected twists and turns, how surprising would it really be if the result itself were to spring the biggest surprise of all?",formal

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- There are some circuits that are cornerstones of the Formula 1 calendar: the Monacos and Silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers. Then there are the newer circuits -- Malaysia and Bahrain, for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins. Fuji Speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view. Next week they have something completely new to contend with: a track that has yet to see a single F1 team put in a single lap. The Japan Grand Prix is to return to the Fuji Speedway, a circuit that hasn't seen an F1 race since 1977 (though now with a substantially different track layout). The Fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games. The old Fuji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position (released by Namco in Japan and Atari in the rest of the world). The most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain, looming in the distance. Though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies. The Suzuka track -- which had held Japanese Grands Prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike, but for this year and the next the Japanese Grand Prix will be held at Fuji. However an announcement by Formula One Management (FOM) this month revealed that Suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the Japanese Grand Prix alternating yearly between Fuji and Suzuka after that. Behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with F1 connections -- Honda owns Suzuka, Toyota owns Fuji. Toyota is a relative newcomer to F1 but, having this year surpassed General Motors as the world's number one automobile manufacturer, and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock (a position that hasn't been reflected in sporting success), it is not without clout. The redesign of the Fuji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003. Tilke, a German architect redesigned a number of F1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Malaysia, Istanbul, Bahrain and Shanghai, and the tracks for 2008's debut grands prix in Singapore and Valencia. So how do F1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as Fuji without data from previous races to fall back on? The answer lies with computer simulation. Computer-aided design (CAD) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars. Every bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself. Despite never having raced on the circuit, the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual Fuji Speedway for some time. BMW Sauber's simulation experts received CAD data from the Japanese race organizers late last year. And when their cars arrive at Fuji for testing next week, their race set-up should be close to optimum. The circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments. The radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line (the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance). Then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated. The slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car. ""In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance,"" says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team. Dieter Glass, Chief Race and Test Engineer with Toyota F1 explains: . ""You start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit. Once you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce, before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions. ""Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy. This prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time. If you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried."" One peculiarity of the Fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight, which at 1.475 km (0.916 miles) will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but, after the straight the track is relatively twisty. The teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends. ""You have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip,"" says Glass, ""and as always you want good grip in general, but you have to balance that with the long straight, where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed."" The testing may be virtual, but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair's breadth away from real world eventualities: . ""Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values,"" says Rampf. Not that everything can be predicted: ""I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race,"" continues Glass. ""Many incidents can happen, which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy."" E-mail to a friend .",formal
"COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/98/EC of 20 December 1996 on marine equipment THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 84 (2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189c of the Treaty (3), (1) Whereas within the framework of the common transport policy further measures must be adopted to ensure safety in maritime transport; (2) Whereas shipping accidents are a matter of serious concern to the Community, in particular those that cause loss of human life and pollution of the Member States' seas and coastlines; (3) Whereas the risk of shipping accidents can be effectively reduced by means of common standards that ensure high safety levels in the performance of the equipment carried on board ships; whereas testing standards and testing methods can have great influence on the future performance of equipment; (4) Whereas international conventions require flag States to ensure that the equipment carried on board ships complies with certain safety requirements and to issue the relevant certificates; whereas to that end testing standards for certain types of marine equipment have been developed by the international standardization bodies and by the International Maritime Organization (IMO); whereas the national testing standards implementing the international standards leave a margin of discretion certification authorities, which themselves have different levels of qualifications and experience; whereas that leads to varying levels of safety for products which the competent national authorities have certified as complying with the relevant international safety standards and to great reluctance on the part of Member States to accept that without further verification ships flying their flags carry equipment approved by other Member States; (5) Whereas common rules must be laid down to eliminate differences in the implementation of international standards; whereas such common rules will result in the elimination of unnecessary costs and administrative procedures relating to the approval of equipment, the improvement of operating conditions and of the competitive position of Community shipping and the elimination of technical barriers to trade by means of the mark of conformity affixed to equipment; (6) Whereas in its resolution of 8 June 1993 on a common policy on safe seas (4) the Council urged the Commission to submit proposals for harmonizing the implementation of IMO standards and the procedures for the approval of marine equipment; (7) Whereas action at Community level is the only possible way of achieving such harmonization, since Member States acting independently or through international organizations cannot establish the same level of safety performance in equipment; (8) Whereas a Council Directive is the appropriate legal instrument as it provides a framework for uniform and compulsory application of the international testing standards by Member States; (9) Whereas it is appropriate in the first place to address equipment the carriage of which on board ship and the approval of which by national administrations in accordance with safety standards laid down in international conventions or resolutions is mandatory under the main international conventions; (10) Whereas there are various Directives that ensure the free movement of certain products which could be used inter alia, as equipment on board ships but which do not concern the Member States' certification of equipment in accordance with the relevant international conventions; whereas equipment to be placed on board ships must therefore be regulated exclusively by new common rules; (11) Whereas new testing standards must be laid down, preferably at international level, for equipment for which such standards do not already exist or are not sufficiently detailed; (12) Whereas Member States should ensure that the notified bodies that assess the compliance of equipment with testing standards are independent, efficient and professionally competent to carry out their tasks; (13) Whereas compliance with international testing standards can best be demonstrated by means of conformity-assessment procedures such as those laid down in Council Decision 93/465/EEC of 22 July 1993 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity-assessment procedures and the rules for the affixing and use of the CE conformity marking, which are intended to be used in the technical harmonization Directives (5); (14) Whereas nothing in this Directive restricts the right granted to a flag State administration by international conventions to carry out operational-performance tests on board a ship for which it has issued a safety certificate, provided such tests do not duplicate the conformity-assessment procedures; (15) Whereas equipment covered by this Directive should, as a general rule, bear a mark to indicate its compliance with the requirement of this Directive; (16) Whereas Member States may in certain cases take provisional measures to limit or prohibit the use of equipment bearing the mark of conformity; (17) Whereas the use of equipment not bearing the mark of conformity may be allowed in exceptional circumstances; (18) Whereas a simplified procedure involving a regulatory committee must be followed for the amendment of this Directive, HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 The purpose of this Directive shall be to enhance safety at sea and the prevention of marine pollution through the uniform application of the relevant international instruments relating to equipment listed in Annex A to be placed on board ships for which safety certificates are issued by or on behalf of Member States pursuant to international conventions and to ensure the free movement of such equipment within the Community.

The mandates issued by the Commission shall aim for the development of international standards through procedures for cooperation between the European bodies and their counterparts at international level. 3. Member States shall do their utmost to ensure that the international organizations, including the IMO, develop those standards expeditiously. 4. The Commission shall monitor the development of the testing standards on a regular basis. 5. Should the international organizations, including the IMO, fail or refuse to adopt appropriate testing standards for a specific item of equipment within a reasonable time, standards based on the work of the European standardization organizations may be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18. 6. When the testing standards referred to in paragraphs 1 or 5 are adopted or enter into force, as appropriate, for a specific item of equipment, that equipment may be transferred from Annex A.2 to Annex A.1 in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18 and, Article 5 shall apply from the date of that transfer. Article 8 1. In the case of a new ship which, irrespective of its flag, is not registered in a Member State but is to be transferred to the register of a Member State, such a ship shall, on transfer, be subject to inspection by the receiving Member State to verify that the actual condition of its equipment corresponds to its safety certificates and either complies with this Directive and bears the mark or is equivalent, to the satisfaction of that Member State's administration, to equipment type-approval in accordance with this Directive. 2. Unless the equipment either bears the mark or that administration considers it to be equivalent, it shall be replaced. 3. Equipment which is considered equivalent pursuant to this Article shall be given a certificate by the Member State which shall at all times be carried with the equipment and which gives the flag Member State's permission for the equipment to be placed on board the ship and imposes any restrictions or lays down any provisions relating to the use of the equipment. 4. In the case of radiocommunications equipment, the flag State administration shall require that such equipment does not unduly affect the requirements of the radio-frequency spectrum. Article 9 1. Member States shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of the bodies which they have designated to carry out the procedures for in Article 10 together with the specific tasks which those notified bodies have been designated to carry out and the identification numbers assigned to them beforehand by the Commission. Each organization shall submit to the Member State which intends to designate it complete information concerning, and evidence of compliance with the criteria laid down in Annex C. 2. At least once every two years each Member State shall cause an audit of the duties its notified bodies are undertaking on its behalf to be carried out by the administration or by an impartial external organization appointed by the administration. That audit shall ensure that each notified body continues to comply with the criteria laid down in Annex C. 3. A Member State which has designated a body shall withdraw its designation if it finds that that body no longer complies with the criteria laid down in Annex C. It shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly. Article 10 1. The conformity-assessment procedure, details of which are listed in Annex B, shall be: (i) EC type-examination (module B) and, before equipment is placed on the market and according to the choice made by the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community from the possibilities indicated in Annex A.1, all equipment shall be subject to: (a) the EC declaration of conformity to type (module C); (b) the EC declaration of conformity to type (production-quality assurance) (module D); (c) the EC declaration of conformity to type (product-quality assurance) (module E); (d) the EC declaration of conformity to type (product verification) (module F); or (ii) EC full-quality assurance (module H). 2. The declaration of conformity to type shall be in written form and shall give the information specified in Annex B. 3. Where sets of equipment are produced individually or in small quantities and not in series or in mass, the conformity-assessment procedure may be the EC unit verification (module G). 4. The Commission shall keep an up-to-date list of approved equipment and applications withdrawn or refused and shall make it available to interested parties. Article 11 1. Equipment referred to in Annex A.1 which complies with the relevant international instruments and is manufactured in accordance with the conformity-assessment procedures shall have the mark affixed to it by the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community. 2. The mark shall be followed by the identification number of the notified body which has performed the conformity-assessment procedure, if that body is involved in the production-control phase, and by the last two digits of the number of the year in which the mark is affixed. The identification number of the notified body shall be affixed under its responsibility either by the body itself or by the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community. 3. The form of the mark to be used shall be as set out in Annex D. 4. The mark shall be affixed to the equipment or to its data plate so as to be visible, legible and indelible throughout the anticipated useful life of the equipment. However, where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the piece of equipment, it shall be affixed to the packaging of the product, to a label or to a leaflet. 5. No marks or inscriptions which are likely to mislead third parties with regard to the meaning or the graphics of the mark referred to in this Directive shall be affixed. 6. The mark shall be affixed at the end of the production phase. Article 12 1. Notwithstanding Article 6, each Member State may take the measures necessary to ensure that sample checks are carried out on equipment bearing the mark which is on its market and which has not yet been placed on board, in order to ensure that it complies with this Directive. Sample checks which are not provided for in the modules for conformity assessment in Annex B shall be carried out at the expense of the Member State. 2. Notwithstanding Article 6, after the installation of equipment which complies with this Directive on board a Community ship, evaluation by that ship's flag State administration of that equipment shall be permitted when operational on-board performance tests are required by international instruments for safety and/or pollution-prevention purposes, provided that they do not duplicate the conformity-assessment procedures already carried out. The flag State administration may require the manufacturer of the equipment, his authorized representative established within the Community or the person responsible for marketing the equipment within the Community to provide the inspection/testing reports. Article 13 1. Where a Member State ascertains by inspection or otherwise that, notwithstanding the fact that it bears the mark, a piece of equipment referred to in Annex A.1, when correctly installed, maintained and used for its intended purpose, may compromise the health and/or safety of the crew, the passengers or, where applicable, other persons, or adversely affect the marine environment from the market or prohibit or restrict its being placed on the market or being used on board a ship for which it issues the safety certificates. The Member State shall immediately inform the other Member States and the Commission of that measure and indicate the reasons for its decision and, in particular, whether non-compliance with this Directive is due to: (a) failure to comply with Article 5 (1) and (2); (b) incorrect application of the testing standards referred to in Article 5 (1) and (2); or (c) shortcomings in the testing standards themselves. 2. The Commission shall enter into consultation with the parties concerned as soon as possible. Where, after such consultation, the Commission finds that: - the measures are justified, it shall immediately so inform the Member State which took the initiative and the other Member States; where the decision referred to in paragraph 1 is attributed to shortcomings in the testing standards, the Commission shall, after consulting the parties concerned, bring the matter before the Committee referred to in Article 18 within two months if the Member State which has taken the decision intends to maintain it and shall initiate the procedure referred to in Article 18, - the measures are unjustified, it shall immediately so inform the Member State which took the initiative and the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community. 3. Where a non-complying piece of equipment bears the mark, the appropriate measures shall be taken by the Member State which has authority over whomsoever affixed the mark; that Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the measures it has taken. 4. The Commission shall ensure that the Member States are kept informed of the progress and outcome of this procedure. Article 14 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 5, in exceptional circumstances of technical innovation, the flag State administration may permit equipment which does not comply with the conformity-assessment procedures to be placed on board a Community ship if it is established by trial or otherwise to the satisfaction of the flag State administration that such equipment is at least as effective as equipment which does comply with the conformity-assessment procedures. In the case of radiocommunications equipment, the flag State administration shall require that such equipment does not unduly affect the requirements of the radio-frequency spectrum. 2. Such trial procedures shall in no way discriminate between equipment produced in the flag Member State and equipment produced in other States. 3. Equipment covered by this Article shall be given a certificate by the flag Member State which shall at all times be carried with the equipment and which gives the flag Member State's permission for the equipment to be placed on board the ship and imposes any restrictions or lays down any provisions relating to the use of the equipment. 4. Where a Member State allows equipment covered by this Article to be placed on board a Community ship, that Member State shall forthwith communicate the particulars thereof together with the reports of all relevant trials, assessments and conformity-assessment procedures to the Commission and the other Member States. 5. Equipment such as is referred to in paragraph 1 shall be added to Annex A.2 in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18. 6. Where a ship with equipment on board which is covered by paragraph 1 is transferred to another Member State, the receiving flag Member State may undertake the measures necessary, which may include tests and practical demonstrations, to ensure that the equipment is at least as effective as equipment which does comply with the conformity-assessment procedures. Article 15 1. Notwithstanding Article 5, a flag State administration may permit equipment which does not comply with the conformity-assessment procedures or is not covered by Article 14 to be placed on board a Community ship for reasons of testing or evaluation, but only when the following conditions are complied with: (a) the equipment must be given a certificate by the flag Member State which must at all times be carried with the equipment and which gives the flag Member State permission for the equipment to be placed on board the Community ship and imposes any restrictions or lays down any provisions relating to the use of the equipment; (b) the permission must be limited to a short period of time; (c) the equipment must not be relied on in place of equipment which meets the requirements of this Directive and must not replace such equipment, which must remain on board the Community ship in working and ready for immediate use. 2. In the case of radiocommunications equipment, the flag State administration shall require that such equipment does not unduly affect the requirements of the radio-frequency spectrum. Article 16 1. Where equipment needs to be replaced in a port outwith the Community and in exceptional circumstances which shall be duly justified to the flag State administration where it is not practicable in terms of reasonable time, delay and cost to place on board equipment which is EC type-approved, other equipment may be placed on board in accordance with the following procedure: (a) the equipment shall be accompanied by documentation issued by a recognized organization equivalent to a notified body, where an agreement has been concluded between the Community and the third country concerned on the mutual recognition of such organizations; (b) should it prove impossible to comply with (a), equipment accompanied by documentation issued by a Member State of the IMO which is a party to the relevant conventions, certifying compliance with the relevant IMO requirements, may be placed on board, subject to paragraphs 2 and 3. 2. The flag State administration shall be informed at once of the nature and characteristics of such other equipment. 3. The flag State administration shall, at the earliest opportunity, ensure that the equipment referred to in paragraph 1, along with its testing documentation, complies with the relevant requirements of the international instruments and of this Directive. 4.

"(CNN) -- One Australian soldier, three civilians and Taliban militants were killed early Friday during heavy fighting in southern Afghanistan, according to information from Australian and NATO officials. Four Australian troops have now died in the conflict in Afghanistan. The incident occurred in Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan province, where Taliban militants killed an Australian commando, the Australian Defence Ministry said. The 26-year-old commando -- Pvt. Luke Worsley of Sydney -- served with the Special Operations Task Group. This is the fourth Australian troop to die in the Afghan conflict. ""The action in which Private Worsley died only concluded in the last few hours and was characterized by heavy, close quarter fighting. The SOTG was conducting an operation to clear an identified Taliban bomb making facility in Uruzgan province, when the soldier was hit by small arms fire,"" Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said ""a significant number of Taliban insurgents were killed or captured as part of the operation. Taliban insurgents initiated the firefight which lasted several hours."" Gen. Carlos Branco, ISAF spokesman, said it is not known how the civilians, two women and a child, died. ""However, we do know that the insurgents fired upon ISAF soldiers from the compound in which the Afghan civilians (two women and one child) were found after the fight.

"KHARTOUM, Sudan (CNN) -- A Sudanese court found a British teacher guilty of insulting religion and sentenced her to 15 days in prison Thursday for allowing a teddy bear to be named ""Mohammed,"" British authorities and her lawyer reported. An undated amateur photo of Gillian Gibbons, who has been found guilty of insulting religion. Gillian Gibbons also faces deportation from Sudan after her prison term, her lawyer told CNN. He said that he was ""very disappointed"" with the verdict and that Gibbons planned to appeal. Gibbons was not convicted of two other charges brought against her -- inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs, her lawyer said. Gibbons, 54, was arrested Sunday after she asked her class of 7-year-olds in Khartoum to name the stuffed animal as part of a school project, the British Foreign Office said. She had faced charges under Article 125 of Sudan's constitution, the law relating to insulting religion and inciting hatred. Although there is no ban in the Quran on images of Allah or the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder, likenesses are considered highly offensive by Muslims. Watch latest developments in the case. » . Appearing somber and dazed, Gibbons arrived at the central courthouse in Khartoum for her closed hearing early Thursday. A staff member from the British Embassy in Khartoum and defense lawyers attended the hearing with her. The courthouse was heavily guarded by police, who kept journalists -- and, for a while, even one of her attorneys -- away. Gibbons could have faced a sentence of 40 lashes, a fine, or a jail term of up to a year, according to the Foreign Office, which expressed Britain's dissatisfaction with the verdict. ""We are extremely disappointed that the charges against Gillian Gibbons were not dismissed,"" Foreign Secretary David Miliband said in a statement issued shortly after the verdict was announced. ""As I said this morning, our clear view is that this is an innocent misunderstanding by a dedicated teacher. Our priority now is to ensure Ms. Gibbons' welfare, and we will continue to provide consular assistance to her. I have called in the Sudanese ambassador, Omer Siddig, this evening to explain the decision and discuss next steps."" Watch a report on reactions to the verdict » . The Foreign Office said Gibbons would be given credit for the four days since her arrest, meaning that the she has 11 days remaining on her sentence. Earlier, Miliband had met with Siddig, who was summoned to the Foreign Office in London. ""I explained to him that we were very concerned by the case. We believe that this was an innocent misunderstanding,"" Miliband said in a statement released Thursday after the meeting. ""The Sudanese ambassador undertook to ensure our concerns were relayed to Khartoum at the highest level. He also said he would reflect back to Khartoum the real respect for the Islamic religion in this country,"" the statement added. On the first floor of the courthouse, around 25 police linked arms and forced journalists and British officials away from the court entrance. Police detained some journalists, and confiscated a camera belonging to a freelance CNN cameraman. Four vans filled with riot police were waiting outside the courthouse, but there were no signs of street disturbances or protests. Staff from Gibbons' school, including Robert Boulos, the head of Unity High School, were present. The staff members refused to comment on their colleague's predicament. On Wednesday, Boulos said he was ""horrified"" when he found out that the complaint about the naming of the bear came from a member of his own staff -- not from a parent, as originally thought. Defense counsel later confirmed that the complaint came from Sarah Khawad, a secretary at the school. Gibbons has been working at the school -- popular with wealthy Sudanese and expatriates -- since August, after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in Liverpool, England, this summer, Boulos said. He said Gibbons asked the children to pick their favorite name for the new class mascot, which she was using to aid lessons about animals and their habitats. E-mail to a friend .

"A University College London team spoke to paediatricians at 177 hospitals in England and Wales and found poor knowledge on identifying underweight children and serious complications. This was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder. The Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training. Study leader Dr Lee Hudson from the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said more under-13s now presented with eating disorders than meningitis due to the success of vaccination programmes. This shift in childhood illness may be one reason why his research suggested a lack of knowledge on spotting underweight children and the associated medical problems, he added. In the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children. During a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications. Only half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older children or adolescents were underweight, as advised in international guidelines. And only one in five said they would adjust that for appropriate cut-offs in children. There was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels. The researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to look for in tests checking that the heart was working properly, the team reported in Archives of Diseases in Childhood. Doctors also scored poorly on knowledge of dangerous complications associated with giving nutrition to someone who has not eaten for a while or is severely malnourished. Dr Hudson said this was not a criticism of doctors because eating disorders tended to present with vague symptoms, but highlighted a gap in training. ""In addition to that, services for children with eating disorders are very hit and miss around the country."" But he stressed that as those surveyed would be the first paediatricians to assess such children, especially out of hours, they needed to know how to spot dangerously underweight children and teenagers and signs of severe complications. ""From previous research we know that a third of children who are underweight present with life-threatening features,"" he added. Prof Russell Viner, a co-author of the study but also a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, said the college was aware there was a training need around eating disorders and underweight issues. ""We are refreshing training on adolescent health,"" he said. ""And in association with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry we are developing a training programme around mental health in adolescents.""",formal
"REGULATION (EC) No 1717/2006 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 November 2006 establishing an Instrument for Stability THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 179(1) and 181a thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty (1), Whereas: (1) The Community is a major provider of economic, financial, technical, humanitarian and macroeconomic assistance to third countries. The promotion of stable conditions for human and economic development and the promotion of human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms remains one of the prime objectives of European Union (hereinafter referred to as ‘the EU’) external action to which Community instruments for external assistance contribute. The Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, in their November 2004 Conclusions on the effectiveness of EU External Action, concluded that ‘peace, security and stability as well as human rights, democracy and good governance, are essential elements for sustainable economic growth and poverty eradication’. (2) The EU Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts, endorsed by the European Council, underlines the EU's ‘political commitment to pursue conflict prevention as one of the main objectives of the EU's external relations’ and states that Community development cooperation instruments can contribute to this goal and to the development of the EU as a global player. (3) Measures taken under this Regulation in pursuit of the objectives of Articles 177 and 181a of the Treaty establishing the European Community (hereinafter referred to as ‘the EC Treaty’) may be complementary to and should be consistent with measures adopted by the EU in pursuit of Common Foreign and Security Policy objectives within the framework of Title V and measures adopted within the framework of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union (hereinafter referred to as ‘the EU Treaty’). The Council and the Commission should cooperate to ensure such consistency, each in accordance with their respective powers. (4) The European Consensus on Development, adopted by the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on 22 November 2005 and welcomed by the European Council on 15 and 16 December 2005, states that the Community, within the respective competences of its institutions, will develop a comprehensive prevention approach to State fragility, conflict, natural disasters and other types of crises, to which goal this Regulation should contribute. (5) The European Council approved the European Security Strategy on 12 December 2003. (6) The European Council Declaration on Combating Terrorism of 25 March 2004 called for counter-terrorist objectives to be integrated into external assistance programmes. Moreover, the EU Millennium Strategy on the prevention and control of organised crime, adopted by the Council on 27 March 2000, calls for closer cooperation with third countries. (7) Post-crisis stabilisation requires a sustained and flexible engagement from the international community, in particular in the first years after a crisis, on the basis of integrated transition strategies. (8) Implementation of programmes of assistance in times of crisis and political instability requires specific measures to ensure flexibility in decision-making and budget allocation, as well as enhanced measures to ensure coherence with bilateral aid and mechanisms for the pooling of donor funds, including the delegation of public authority tasks through indirect centralised management. (9) The Resolutions of the European Parliament and the Conclusions of the Council following the Commission Communications on the Linking of Relief, Rehabilitation and Development emphasise the need to ensure effective bridging between operations financed from different Community financing instruments in the context of crisis. (10) In order to address the above issues in an effective and timely manner specific financial resources and financing instruments are required that can work in a manner complementary to humanitarian aid and long-term cooperation instruments. Humanitarian aid should continue to be delivered under Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 of 20 June 1996 concerning humanitarian aid (2). (11) In addition to the measures agreed with partner countries in the context of the policy framework for cooperation established under the related Community instruments for external assistance, the Community must be able to provide assistance which addresses major global and transnational issues having a potentially destabilising effect. (12) The 2001 ‘Guidelines for strengthening operational coordination between the Community, represented by the Commission, and the Member States in the field of external assistance’ emphasise the need for enhanced coordination of EU external assistance. (13) This Regulation establishes for the period 2007 to 2013 a financial envelope which constitutes the prime reference amount for the budgetary authority according to point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (3). (14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4). (15) This Regulation aims at covering the scope of and replacing a number of existing Regulations concerning Community external assistance; those Regulations should therefore be repealed. (16) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, because of the need for concerted multilateral response in the areas defined in this Regulation, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, taking account of the scale and global effects of the measures provided for herein, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve these objectives, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: TITLE I OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE Article 1 Objectives 1.

"COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 3287/94 of 22 December 1994 on pre-shipment inspections for exports from the Community THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION; Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1), Whereas a number of developing countries have recourse to so-called pre-shipment inspection programmes in order to ensure a proper distribution of limited foreign currency resources to importers and in order to combat such practices as over- and under-invoicing and fraud; whereas these developing countries have charged private companies with this task, which includes a check on quality, as well as price of the goods intended for export to the territory of these countries; Whereas the Community recognizes the right of the developing countries to have recourse to pre-shipment inspection; whereas, however, pre-shipment inspection can give rise to abusive interference in the price freely agreed between parties to a contract and to other practices which form unnecessary obstacles to trade; whereas, therefore, efforts should be made through cooperation and technical assistance to reduce the need for pre-shipment inspection; Whereas the Uruguay Round Final Act, signed on 15 April 1994 in Marakesh (Morocco), establishes an Agreement on pre-shipment inspection between members of the World Trade Organization (‘WTO Agreement’); whereas this Agreement has been approved and needs to be put into effect for the Community; Whereas Community legislation provides exporters with additional assurance that pre-shipment inspection activities are indeed carried out according to the provisions of the WTO Agreement and thus do not constitute a barrier to trade; Whereas, to this end, pre-shipment inspection activities carried out in the Community should be made subject to certain conditions; Whereas, in view of the maintenance of uniform principles of export policy of the Community it is necessary that the activities of pre-shipment inspection entities be regulated along uniform lines; Whereas there is good reason to simplify procedures as much as possible, in particular with respect to the review of prices; whereas exemptions, however, are not provided by the WTO Agreement and such exemption can thus be applied only with the agreement of the pre-shipment inspection entities; Whereas a quick and effective procedure for the settlement of disputes between exporters and pre-shipment inspection entities should be instituted; whereas such a procedure is provided by the WTO Agreement; Whereas disputes concerning non-compliance with conditions or non-observance of procedures by pre-shipment inspection entities should be settled with the third countries making use of such entities in accordance with the relevant Community and WTO procedures; Whereas Article 3 (3) of the WTO Agreement provides for technical assistance to third countries, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 This Regulation applies to activities carried out on the customs territory of the European Community by pre-shipment inspection entities which, for the account of governments of public entities, of third countries, carry out controls on the quality, quantity or price, including exchange rate and financial terms, of goods destined for export to the territory of these third countries (‘pre-shipment inspection programmes’). Article 2 1. The activities of pre-shipment inspection entities as defined in Article 1 are subject to a procedure for prior notification on a generic basis under the conditions set out in this Regulation. 2. In their notification, the pre-shipment entities shall communicate to the Commission the provisions, with the exception of remuneration, of contracts agreed with governments or public entities of third countries for the account of which the pre-shipment inspection programmes have been put in place. They shall subsequently notify all modifications regarding conditions for control to the Commission. They shall also indicate which measures they have taken to comply with the conditions set out in this Regulation. 3. The Commission shall copy all the notifications received to the Member States. Article 3 The notification of activities mentioned in Article 2 shall cover the following activities: (a) physical inspection of merchandise before it is exported in order to verify the conformity of the dispatch (quality, quantity) with the specifications of the contract and the respect of rules and standards of the importing country or recognized at international level; (b) verification of the price and where applicable, the currency exchange rate, on the basis of the contract between the exporter and the importer, the pro forma invoice and, where applicable, the application for import authorization. Article 4 Pre-shipment inspection entities, when carrying out their activities, shall meet the following conditions: (a) Prior to any control, the pre-shipment inspection entity shall inform the exporter of the details of the inspection and the criteria that will be applied. The pre-shipment inspection entity shall carry out the appropriate controls in a time span that avoids unreasonable delays. It shall also, following receipt of the final documents and completion of the inspection, within five working days, either issue a Clean Report of Findings or provide a detailed written explanation specifying the reasons for non-issuance. In the latter case exporters shall be given the opportunity to present their views in writing and, if exporters so request, arrange for reinspection at the earliest mutually convenient date. Pre-shipment inspection entities shall also undertake, whenever so requested by the exporter, prior to the date of physical inspection, a preliminary verification of price and, where applicable, of currency exchange rate, on the basis of the contract between exporter and importer, the pro forma invoice and, where applicable, the application for import authorization. They shall, after a preliminary verification has taken place, immediately inform exporters in writing either of their acceptance or of their detailed reasons for non-acceptance of the price and/or currency exchange rate. In order to avoid delays in payment, pre-shipment inspection entities shall send to exporters or to designated representatives or the exporters a Clean Report of Findings as expeditiously as possible. They shall also, in the event of a clerical error in the Clean Report of Findings, correct the error and forward the corrected information to the appropriate parties as expeditiously as possible. (b) The pre-shipment inspections shall be carried out in a non-discriminatory manner, and the procedures and criteria employed in the conduct of these activities shall be objective and applied on an equal basis to all exporters affected by such activities. (c) Pre-shipment inspection entities shall not request exporters to provide information regarding: (i) manufacturing data related to patented, licensed or indisclosed processes, or to processes for which a patent is pending; (ii) unpublished technical data other than data necessary to demonstrate compliance with technical regulations or standards; (iii) internal pricing, including manufacturing costs; (iv) profit levels; (v) the terms of contracts between exporters and their suppliers unless it is not otherwise possible for the entity to conduct the inspection in question. (In such cases, the entity shall only request the information necessary for this purpose). Pre-shipment inspection entities shall treat all information provided by exporters as business confidential, to the extent that such information is not already published, generally available to third parties, or otherwise in the public domain. Such business confidential information shall be shared with the governments contracting or mandating the entity only to the extent that such information is customarily required for letters of credit or other forms of payment or for customs, import licensing or exchange control purposes. (d) Pre-shipment inspection entities shall establish procedures to receive, consider and render decisions concerning grievances raised by the exporters. These procedures shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the following guidelines: (i) pre-shipment inspection entities shall designate one or more officials who shall be available during normal business hours in each city or port in which they maintain a pre-shipment inspection administrative office to receive, consider and render decisions on exporters' appeals or grievances; (ii) exporters shall provide in writing to the designated official(s) the facts concerning the specific transaction in question, the nature of the grievance and a suggested solution; (iii) the designated official(s) shall afford sympathetic consideration to exporters' grievances and shall render a decision as soon as possible after receipt of the documentation referred to in subparagraph (ii). Article 5 Pre-shipment inspection entities, when carrying out their activity with respect to price verification, shall meet the following conditions: (a) pre-shipment inspection entities shall only reject a contract price agreed between an exporter and an importer if they can demonstrate that their findings of an unsatisfactory price are based on a verification process which is in conformity with the criteria set out in subparagraphs (b) to (e) inclusive; (b) the pre-shipment inspection entity shall base its price comparison for the verification of the export price on the price(s) of identical or similar goods offered for export from the same country of exportation at or about the same time, under competitive and comparable conditions of sale, in conformity with customary commercial practices and net of any applicable standard discounts. Such comparison shall be based on the following: (i) only prices providing a valid basis of comparison shall be used, taking into account the relevant economic factors pertaining to the country of importation and a country or countries used for price comparison; (ii) the pre-shipment inspection entity shall not rely upon the price of goods offered for export to different countries of importation to arbitrarily impose the lowest price upon the shipment; (iii) the pre-shipment inspection entity shall take into account the specific elements listed in subparagraph (c); (iv) at any stage in the process described above, the pre-shipment inspection entity shall provide the exporter with an opportunity to explain the price; (c) when conducting price verification, pre-shipment inspection entities shall make appropriate allowances for the terms of the sales contract and generally applicable adjusting factors pertaining to the transaction; these factors shall include but not be limited to the commercial level and quantity of the sale, delivery periods and conditions, price escalation clauses, quality specifications, special design features, special shipping or packing specifications, order size, spot sales, seasonal influences, license or other intellectual property fees, and services rendered as part of the contract if these are not customarily invoiced separately; they shall also include certain elements relating to the exporter's price, such as the contractual relationship between the exporter and importer; (d) the verification of transportation charges shall relate only to the agreed price of the mode of transport in the country of exportation as indicated in the sales contract; (e) the following shall not be used for price verification purposes: (i) the selling price in the country of importation of goods produced in such country; (ii) the price of goods for export from a country other than the country of exportation; (iii) the cost of production; (iv) arbitrary or fictitious prices or values. Article 6 If, as a result of its obligations towards the government or a public entity of a third country, the pre-shipment inspection entity does not observe the conditions set out in Articles 4 and 5 of this Regulation, if the entity does not comply with the procedures set out in Article 7, or if there is any other reason to believe that the WTO Agreement is not respected, recourse may be had to any appropriate procedure, including the procedure laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 2641/84 under the conditions set out therein (2). Article 7 If pre-shipment inspection entities and exporters cannot resolve their disputes otherwise and at the earliest two working days after submission of the grievances in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of Article 4, the following procedure shall normally be applied: (a) an exporter or pre-shipment inspection entity wishing to raise a dispute shall contact the independent entity referred to in Article 4 of the WTO Agreement on pre-shipment inspection and request the formation of a panel. The independent entity shall be responsible for establishing a panel. This panel shall consist of three members. The members of the panel shall be chosen so as to avoid unnecessary costs and delays. The first member shall be chosen from section (i) of the list provided for in the WTO Agreement by the pre-shipment inspection entity concerned, provided that this member is not affiliated to that entity. The second member shall be chosen from section (ii) of the list provided for in the WTO Agreement by the exporter concerned, provided that this member is not affiliated to that exporter. The third member shall be chosen from section (iii) of the list provided for in the WTO Agreement by the independent entity referred to above. No objections shall be made to any independent trade expert drawn from section (iii) of the list provided for in the WTO Agreement; (b) the independent trade expert drawn from section (iii) of the list provided for in the WTO Agreement shall serve as the chairman of the panel. The independent trade expert shall take the necessary decisions to ensure an expeditious settlement of the dispute by the panel, for instance, whether the facts of the case require the panellists to meet and, if so, where such a meeting shall take place, taking into account the site of the inspection in question; (c) if the parties of the dispute so agree, one independent trade expert could be selected from section (iii) of the list provided for in the WTO Agreement on pre-shipment inspection by the independent entity referred to in subparagraph (a) to review the dispute in question. This expert shall take the necessary decisions to ensure an expeditious settlement of the dispute, for instance taking into account the site of the inspection in question; (d) the object of the review shall be to establish whether, in the course of the inspection in dispute, the parties to the dispute have complied with the provisions of the WTO Agreement, and thus with the provisions of this Regulation. The procedures shall be expeditious and provide the opportunity for both parties to present their views in person or in writing; (e) decisions by a three-member panel shall be taken by majority vote. The decision on the dispute shall be rendered within eight working days of the request for independent review and be communicated to the parties of the dispute. This time limit may be extended upon agreement by the parties to the dispute. The panel or independent trade expert shall apportion the costs, based on the merits of the case; (f) the decision of the panel shall be binding upon the pre-shipment inspection entity and the exporter which are parties to the dispute. Article 8 Each Member State shall: - take appropriate measures at the national level for the implementation of the present Regulation, in particular to facilitate the proper operation of the independent review procedure set out in Article 7, - appoint an official responsible for pre-shipment inspection questions, whose name and functions will be communicated to the Commission. The Community and the Member States, if requested, may provide user countries with technical assistance related to pre-shipment inspection; normally such assistance should be aimed at removing the circumstances which have led these countries to resort to pre-shipment inspection. Article 9 The Commission will inform the Secretariat of the WTO of this Regulation and any modification thereof. Article 10 This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1995. This Regulation is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. Done at Brussels, 22 December 1994.",formal

"The Vikings finished outside the top eight in 2015, but last Friday's win at Wigan kept them at the top of the Super League table after seven games. In football, Leicester are five points clear with seven games left. ""It's good, it's better being compared to someone at the top,"" Brown told the BBC Super League Show. ""I don't really listen to what people say about where we finish, as long as we're playing well and doing our thing you can compare us to whoever you want. ""If they're at the top of the league and going to win something, then I hope we can keep it up and they can keep comparing us to them."" Media playback is not supported on this device The Vikings have scored 230 points so this season, the highest in Super League, and only Wigan and Warrington have conceded fewer. Key to their improvement has been the acquisition of strong forwards and a toughness instilled by head coach Denis Betts and his coaching staff. ""Our attack has been pretty good for the last few years but the fact we've got real lads working their socks off in the middle coupled with some really good edge defenders,"" said Brown. ""The lads who have come in have helped our attack but Chris Houston, Corey Thompson, Chris Bridge, Charly Runciman - these lads are competent, experienced players who know how to defend. ""Above everything the defensive side of game has improved out of sight."" Media playback is not supported on this device No team has scored more tries than the 42 by Widnes, an average of six per game.

""From Monday to Sunday it's fun all the way, the coaching staff make sure we're working hard and putting everything into it.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Thursday criticized a recent vote by Democratic presidential rival Sen. Hillary Clinton as helping to give President Bush a ""blank check"" to take military action against Iran. Sen. Barack Obama says Sen. Hillary Clinton has shown ""flawed"" judgment. ""We know in the past that the president has used some of the flimsiest excuses to try to move his agenda regardless of what Congress says,"" Obama said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Last month, Clinton voted to support a resolution declaring Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite part of the Iranian military, a foreign terrorist group. (The nonbinding amendment to the Defense Authorization Act passed by a 76-22 vote.) Obama said he would have voted against the measure but didn't because he was campaigning in New Hampshire at the time. He said it was impossible to know when votes will be scheduled in the Senate. ""This is a problem"" related to running for president, he said. Obama said Clinton also had shown ""flawed"" judgment during the vote to authorize the Iraq war five years ago. ""We know that there was embodied in this legislation, or this resolution sent to the Senate, language that would say our Iraqi troop structures should in part be determined by our desire to deal with Iran,"" Obama said. ""Now if you know that in the past the president has taken a blank check and cashed it, we don't want to repeat that mistake."" Clinton on Thursday defended her vote on the resolution during an interview on New Hampshire Public Radio, saying ""what I voted on was a nonbinding resolution. It's not an amendment. It's not a law."" While Clinton was campaigning Sunday in New Hampton, Iowa, an audience member at a town hall-style meeting pressed her on why she voted for the Iran measure and asked why she hadn't learned from past ""mistakes."" Calling ""the premise of the question"" wrong, the senator from New York argued the resolution calls for the terrorist label so that sanctions can be imposed. The sanctions, Clinton said, will in turn ""send a clear message to the leadership"" and lead to stronger diplomatic efforts. Earlier this month, Clinton also co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, that would prohibit military operations against Iran without congressional approval. Obama's comments came on the fifth anniversary of the 77-23 Senate vote that authorized the president to use force against Iraq. Obama, then an Illinois state senator, spoke out against the resolution authorizing force at the time. Clinton's 2002 vote shows a clear difference in judgment between the two of them, Obama said. Watch as Obama questions Clinton's judgment » . ""I don't think it disqualified her, but I think it speaks to her judgment and it speaks to my judgment,"" Obama said. ""It speaks to how we will make decisions going forward. ""I think her judgment was flawed on this issue."" Obama said he also will step up efforts to clarify his differences with Clinton, whom many political observers view as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. ""There's no doubt we are moving into a different phase of the campaign,"" Obama said. ""The first part of a campaign is to offer some biography and give people a sense of where I've been and what I am about. ""In this next phase, we want to make sure that voters understand that on big issues, like the decision to go into the war in Iraq, I had real differences with the other candidates, and that reflects on my judgment."" Another leading Democratic candidate, John Edwards, also voted in 2002 to authorize force in Iraq while he was then a senator from North Carolina. He later called his vote a mistake. In a veiled swipe at Clinton, Obama also suggested he could better unite the country and offer ""something new, as opposed to looking backward and simply duplicating some of the politics that we've become so accustomed to, that frankly the American people are sick of."" Obama would not say whether he would consider Clinton as his running mate should he become the Democratic Party's nominee. ""I think Sen. Clinton is a very capable person,"" he said. ""Right now, my goal is to make sure I am the nominee, and she is still the senator from New York."" E-mail to a friend . CNN's Scott Anderson and Alexander Mooney contributed to this report.",formal
"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- After his weekend arrest on gun charges, rapper T.I. will remain in custody until a bond hearing Friday, a federal magistrate said Monday. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested without incident in midtown Atlanta. The entertainer, whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested Saturday just hours before he was scheduled to perform at the BET Hip Hop Awards. The small court room of Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman was packed with family, supporters and media, but even more people, including the rapper's mother, were turned away because of the overcrowding. Harris, 27, was arrested in a federal sting after his bodyguard-turned-informant delivered three machine guns and two silencers to the hip-hop star, according to a Justice Department statement. Watch a search of the rapper's home » . He was held in federal custody over the weekend. Authorities said that Harris provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon. Court documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past. However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that ""a number of people"" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. Thomas added there were ""two sides to every story -- sometimes three"" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor. The entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was taped. Harris, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year. He also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Kanye West. Harris won two awards. The show went on without the self-proclaimed ""King of the South,"" whose car and home in the Atlanta suburb of College Park were searched after his arrest. Authorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, ""including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console."" At his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet. ""Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated,"" said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. ""The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns."" The sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement. The bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said. The guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said. On Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded, the statement said. Harris was supposed to meet the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta to pick up the guns. Authorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department statement said. Court documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation. ""Harris has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for unlawfully possessing firearms,"" according to an affidavit. Harris' music is built around the drug culture and is known as ""trap musik,"" the name of Harris' second album. A ""trap"" is Southern slang for a drug house. Harris soon will appear in the movie ""American Gangster,"" starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. The film is set to open November 2. E-mail to a friend .

Article 2 1. In accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the single programming document includes the following elements: (a) the strategy and priorities for the joint action of the Structural Funds and the Member State; their specific quantified targets; the ex-ante evaluation of the expected impact, including on the environmental situation, and the consistency of the priorities with the economic, social and regional policies and the employment strategy of Spain; The priorities are as follows: 1. improving competitiveness and employment and development of the fabric of production; 2. environment, natural surroundings and water resources; 3. knowledge society (innovation, R & D, information society); 4. development of communications and energy networks; 5. local and urban development; 6. technical assistance; (b) a summary description of the measures planned to implement the priorities, including the information needed to check compliance with the State aid rules under Article 87 of the Treaty; (c) the indicative financing plan specifying for each priority and each year the financial allocation envisaged for the contribution from each Fund, indicating separately the funding planned for the regions receiving transitional support, and the total amounts of eligible public or equivalent expenditure and estimated private funding in the Member State.

The indicative financing plan puts the total cost of the priorities selected for the joint action by the Community and the Member State at EUR 186086390 for the whole period and the financial contribution from the Structural Funds at EUR 90463619. The resulting requirement for national resources of EUR 95622771 from the public sector can be partly met by Community loans from the European Investment Bank and other lending instruments. Article 3 1. The total assistance from the Structural Funds granted under the single programming document amounts to EUR 90463619. Of that amount, EUR 13508756 will be paid immediately and EUR 13572414 will be suspended until the Commission adopts the decision to carry over those appropriations pursuant to the first indent of Article 7(2a) of the Financial Regulation. To the extent to which the amount whose payment is suspended corresponds to budgetary appropriations which will be available as result of the carryover decision, the suspension will be lifted when that decision comes into force. The procedure for granting the financial assistance, including the financial contribution from the Funds for the various priorities included in the single programming document, is set out in the financing plan annexed to this Decision. 2. >TABLE> 3. During implementation of the financing plan, the total cost or Community financing of a given priority may be adjusted in agreement with the Member State by up to 25 % of the total Community contribution to the Single Programming Document throughout the programme period, up to a maximum of EUR 30 million, without altering the total Community contribution referred to in paragraph 1. Article 4 This Decision is without prejudice to the Commission's position on aid schemes falling within Article 87(1) of the Treaty that are included in this assistance and which it has not yet approved. Submission of the application for assistance, the programme complement or a request for payment by the Member State does not replace the notification required by Article 88(3) of the Treaty. Community financing of State aid falling within Article 87(1) of the Treaty, granted under aid schemes or in individual cases, requires prior approval by the Commission under Article 88 of the Treaty, except where the aid falls under the de minimis rule or is exempted under an exemption regulation adopted by the Commission under Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 to certain categories of horizontal State aid(2). In the absence of such exemption or approval, aid is illegal and subject to the consequences set out in the procedural regulation for State aid, and its part-financing would be treated as an irregularity within the meaning of Articles 38 and 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. Consequently, the Commission will not accept requests for interim and final payments under Article 32 of the Regulation for measures being part-financed with new or altered aid, as defined in the procedural regulation for State aid, granted under aid schemes or in individual cases, until such aid has been notified to and formally approved by the Commission. Article 5 The date from which expenditure shall be eligible is 1 January 2000. The closing date for the eligibility of expenditure shall be 31 December 2008. This date is extended to 30 April 2009 for expenditure incurred by bodies granting assistance under Article 9(l) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999.

"Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released a report criticising conditions at a detention centre on the island of Nauru. The report concluded that Australia must intentionally allow abuse of detainees to deter asylum seekers. A statement from the Immigration Department criticised Amnesty for not consulting the government. ""There was no consultation with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection from Amnesty International in preparation of this report,"" the statement said. ""We strongly refute many of the allegations in the report and would encourage Amnesty International to contact the Department before airing allegations of this kind."" The statement said Australia did not exert control over the laws of Nauru, a sovereign country. It said the Australian government welcomed independent scrutiny of its facilities. Australia transports asylum seekers who arrive by boat to off-shore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Read more: Why are asylum seekers so controversial in Australia? The Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report was written after an incognito visit to Nauru last month. The organisations said Australia's actions seemed designed to discourage other migrants from attempting to get to Australia. No documentary evidence was provided in the report to support the claim. But interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers unearthed claims of rape and assault at the hand of Nauruan locals, inadequate medical care and cramped, uncomfortable living conditions. The detention centre at Nauru is run by a company called Broadspectrum and medical services are provided by International Health and Medical Services. Both companies have a contract with the Australian government. One woman quoted in the report said she had married a man 15 years her senior in order to feel safe on the island. Another said Nauruan men had driven her into the jungle with the intent of raping her. Although most held on the island have been identified as genuine refugees and released into the community, many felt afraid to leave their accommodations, particularly at night, the report said. The report also alleged that Nauruan police tended to downplay or ignore asylum seekers' reports of abuse.",formal

It prompted complaints that the signs were spoiling a conservation area. The council said it used railings as much as possible to minimise posts in the pavement. It said it ""met regularly"" with English Heritage to talk about listed building work and legislation. The council said when signs were put up in the Kingsdown conservation area it was advised as long as it was not making ""significant or permanent changes to a building, which would alter its character, it was acceptable"". English Heritage's letter, seen by the BBC, raised the ""potential cumulative impact"" of the signs in West Mall and Caledonia Place, which contains listed buildings. ""We would suggest that taken together such work might fall within Section 7 of the [Planning and Listed Buildings and Conservation 1990] Act,"" it said.

"The report suggested splitting the current role, as both head of the legal system and president of the States. Political expert Dr Adrian Lee said the dual role was unique to the islands. He said they were the only democratic jurisdictions in the world where the person judging a case had been involved in making the law. The Carswell Committee, which authored the report, suggested Jersey's Bailiff should step down as president of the States of Jersey and be replaced by an elected speaker. Lord Carswell said: ""There are various international constitutional documents, which rather frown on the idea of judges having anything to do with the legislator."" He said there was also a practical reason, as in recent years the Jersey Bailiff had had to spend increasing amounts of time on States work. Dr Lee, a former professor of politics at Plymouth University, said: ""The Carswell Committee also made the point that as the two islands increasingly develop their international personalities, as they're called, it's important that their legal systems and political systems are clear to the outside world. ""At the moment there is some lack of clarity over who is speaking on behalf of, who's representing the island - is it the chief minister, the Lieutenant Governor, the Bailiff or is it all three?"" A spokesperson for Guernsey's Policy Council said it would watch the developments in Jersey with interest. Guernsey States Assembly and Constitution Committee said it intended to discuss the report at a meeting next week. The dual role of both bailiffs came under the spotlight after Sark decided to spilt the role of seneschal, who was both chief judge and president of Chief Pleas, in October following pressure from outside of the island.",formal

Chapter 3 Common provisions for supplies of skimmed-milk powder, butter and butteroil Article 7 Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the health standards in force on their territory are met and that there is no fat other than butterfat in the products supplied under this Regulation. Article 8 1. If the skimmed-milk powder or butter to be supplied is purchased on the Community market, the competent body of the Member State in which the tender was lodged shall check that the composition, quality and packaging of the products comply with the conditions laid down in Chapter 1 of this Title. 2. Where the skimmed-milk powder is to contain vitamin additives, or where the butter is to be processed into butteroil, the competent body of the Member State concerned shall check that the provisions laid down in Chapters 1 and 2 of this Title have been complied with during the manufacturing process. 3. The competent body of the Member State shall issue a certificate on completion of the checks referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. The cost of these checks shall be borne by the successful tenderer. 4. For the purposes of the check referred to in paragraph 2, the successful tenderer shall notify the competent control body, in writing, of the date when manufacture is to begin, at least three working days before that date. The lots to be supplied may be dispatched from the place of manufacture and packaging only after authorization by the competent body. 5. From the time when the checks referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 are completed, the products shall be subject to customs control, or to a form of administrative control offering equivalent guarantees, up to the time when they have left the geographical territory of the Community. 6. The quantities supplied shall be checked when subjected to the control referred to in paragraph 5. TITLE III TENDERING AND DIRECT AWARD PROCEDURES Article 9 1. In order to determine the costs of supply including, where appropriate, the price for the purchase or the manufacture and packaging of the skimmed-milk powder, butter or butteroil, a tendering procedure shall be held in accordance with the rules laid down in Articles 10 to 14. 2. In cases of emergency action, however, or when the amounts involved are relatively small, it may be decided to instruct an intervention agency to adopt a direct-award procedure which shall be subject to the rules laid down in Article 15. 3. The party to whom the contract is awarded under a direct-award procedure shall be deemed to be the successful tenderer within the meaning of this Regulation with effect from conclusion of the contract. In such a case the provisions of the contract shall be binding upon the contracting party in the same manner as the provisions of the tendering procedure are binding upon the successful tenderer. Article 10 Where a decision is taken to hold a tendering procedure, a notice of invitation to tender, drawn up in accordance with Annex IV, shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, as an Annex to the Regulation opening the tendering procedure, at least 12 days before the closing date for the submission of tenders. The intervention agencies may publish notices elsewhere. Article 11 1. Interested undertakings which have been approved in accordance with Article 2 shall participate in the tendering procedure either by lodging tenders in writing, against acknowledgement of receipt, with the intervention agency concerned, or by sending tenders to the intervention agency by registered letter or telex. Tenders must reach the intervention agency concerned before 12 noon, local time, on the closing date for the submission of tenders specified in the notice of invitation to tender. 2. If the goods to be supplied are drawn from intervention stocks or manufactured therefrom, tenders shall be submitted to the intervention agency specified in the notice of invitation to tender. If the goods to be supplied are manufactured from products coming from the Community market, tenders shall be submitted to the intervention agency of the Member State in which the goods are to be manufactured and packaged. In other cases, tenders shall be submitted to the intervention agency of the Member State in which the customs export formalities are to be completed. 3. Where the invitation to tender is in respect of several lots, each tender shall relate to one lot only. A tender shall be valid only if it relates to the whole of a lot. The notice of invitation to tender may, however, provide that tenders are still valid if they relate only to a partial quantity amounting to 500 tonnes or a multiple of 500 tonnes from the total lot concerned. In this case, a tenderer whose tender relates to a multiple of 500 tonnes shall state the minimum partial quantity which may be awarded to him. 4. A tender shall be valid only if it states: (a) the reference number of the tendering procedure; (b) the name and address of the tenderer; (c) the description and the net weight of the lot to which the tender relates; (d) a single Community port of shipment, accessible to ocean-going vessels. In the case of supply fob this port shall be selected because of the existence of a connection with the country of destination during the shipment period specified in the notice of invitation to tender. This connection may involve one transhipment in another European Community port, which must also be indicated in the tender; (e) the amount tendered, exclusive of taxes, including the transport costs referred to at (f), expressed in the currency of the Member State to which the tender is submitted and to which the tenderer gives an undertaking to make the supply concerned on the terms laid down; (f) as a separate item: - the transport costs to the port of shipment designated in accordance with the conditions set out at (d) above and the loading costs, - in the case of supplies cif and free-at-destination, the costs relating to sea transport and unloading and, if necessary, inland transport to the final place of destination. 5. A tender which is not submitted in accordance with the provisions of this Article or which contains conditions other than those laid down in respect of the tendering procedure shall not be accepted. 6. No tender shall be valid unless it is also accompanied by: (a) proof of the approval referred to in Article 2 (1); (b) proof that the tendering security referred to in Article 12 has been lodged before the final date for submission of tenders; (c) an undertaking from the tenderer that he will abide by the provisions of this Regulation and the conditions of the tendering procedure; (d) in the case of a delivery of butteroil, the document certifying the approval referred to in Article 5 (3) and, where appropriate, the undertaking referred to in Article 6 (3); (e) an undertaking by the tenderer to apply as promptly as possible for an export licence as provided for in Article 4 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2729/81 in respect of any quantities for which he is awarded a contract; (f) an undertaking by the tenderer that he will comply with the obligations set out in Article 18, and in particular paragraphs 1 and 2 thereof, in the case of supply cif, or in Article 19, and in particular paragraph 1 thereof, in the case of delivery free-at-destination; (g) in the case referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 (d), evidence of the existence of a connection with the country of destination during the shipment period specified in the notice of invitation to tender. 7. Tenders may not be withdrawn. Article 12 1. The tendering security shall be: - in the case of goods drawn from intervention stocks or goods manufactured therefrom, 1 % of the intervention price, - in the case of goods purchased on the Community market or goods manufactured therefrom, 3 % of the intervention price, for skimmed-milk powder or butter, as the case may be, applicable to the quantity to which the tender relates or, in the case of butteroil, to the quantity of butter which corresponds to the quantity to which the tender relates, account being of the provisions of Article 6 (5), on the final date for the submission of tenders. 2. The tendering security shall be lodged, at the option of the tenderer, either in cash or in the form of a guarantee given by a credit establishment which satisfies the criteria laid down by the Member State with which the security is lodged. Each Member State shall communicate the criteria referred to in the preceding subparagraph to the Commission, which shall inform the other Member States thereof. Article 13 1. In the light of the tenders received and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68, a maximum amount shall be fixed in ECU for each lot or part thereof or a decision shall be taken to make no award. Tenders higher than the maximum amount shall be excluded. 2. For the purpose of comparing tenders in the case of a tendering procedure relating to the supply of goods purchased on the Community market or goods manufactured therefrom: (a) each tender shall be corrected by the monetary compensatory amount applicable in the Member State concerned on the final day for the submission of tenders. The correction shall take the form: - either of an increase in the amount of the tenders submitted in a Member State with a negative monetary compensatory amount, - or of a reduction in the amount of the tenders submitted in a Member State with a positive monetary compensatory amount. (b) The rate of exchange to be used for the conversion into ECU of tenders in national currencies thus corrected shall be: - in the case of currencies maintained at all times within a maximum spread of 2,25 %, the central rate for the currency in question, - in all other cases, the average of the spot exchange rates for the currency in question over the period from a given Wednesday to the following Tuesday directly preceding the final day for the submission of tenders. The Commission shall notify the Member States of the said average. 3. In the case of a tendering procedure relating to the supply of goods drawn from intervention stocks or goods manufactured therefrom, the rate to be used for the conversion into ECU of tenders submitted in national currencies shall be the rate referred to in paragraph 2 (b). Article 14 1. Where the maximum amount referred to in Article 13 (1) has been fixed, the contract shall be awarded to the tenderer whose tender is the lowest, or in the case referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 11 (3), to the tenderers whose tenders are the lowest, when converted into ECU in accordance with Article 13. Where several tenders propose the same amount for one lot when converted into ECU, the contract shall be awarded by the drawing of lots. 2. Where a decision is taken to make no award, a second period for the submission of tenders shall begin. This period shall expire on the date set for this purpose in the original notice of invitation to tender. 3. Each tenderer shall immediately be informed by the intervention agency of the outcome of his participation in the tendering procedure. 4. The intervention agency shall immediately notify the Commission of the name and address of the successful tenderer and the port of shipment specified in his tender. Article 15 1. Where a decision is taken to instruct an intervention agency to determine the costs of supply by a direct-award procedure, the intervention agency appointed for the purpose shall, after inviting tenders from several tenderers, conclude the contracts which specify the most favourable terms in relation to the prices obtaining on the market. 2. The provisions laid down in Articles 11 and 12 as regards the tendering procedure shall also apply to the direct-award procedure. 3. The intervention agency shall immediately forward to the Commission a copy of the contract(s) concluded under the direct-award procedure. TITLE IV OBLIGATIONS OF THE SUCCESSFUL TENDERER AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO THE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS Article 16 1. The successful tenderer must fulfil his obligations in accordance with the conditions laid down in the notice of invitation to tender and comply with the undertakings referred to in this Regulation, including those arising from his tender. He shall ensure that the said undertakings are properly implemented and shall grant all possible assistance to this end. 2. The successful tenderer may not unilaterally cancel the operation for which he has been awarded the contract. 3. The rights and obligations arising from the award shall not be transferable. 4.

Article 17 In the case of supplies fob, the following provisions shall apply: 1. The successful tenderer shall duly reach agreement with the recipient, within the shipment period specified in the notice of invitation to tender, on the place of loading and the date on which the loading of goods is to begin at the port of shipment specified in his tender. He shall immediately communicate these particulars to the body responsible for payment, which shall inform the Commission accordingly, and shall state the name of the vessel notified to him by the recipient. 2. Where the product is drawn from intervention stocks, the successful tenderer shall determine the schedule for the removal of the goods in agreement with the intervention agency concerned. 3. The successful tenderer shall deliver the goods on board the vessel designated by the recipient in accordance with a loading schedule adopted in agreement with the latter, having regard to the customary practice at the port.

The successful tenderer shall, having regard to the customary practice at the port, bear all the risks, and in particular those of loss or deterioration, to which the goods are subject until they have effectively passed the ship's rail at the port of shipment or, in the case of transport by liner service, until the taking-over certificate has been issued by the recipient. 5. Where the recipient is unable to take delivery of the goods at the port of shipment either on the date agreed pursuant to point 1 or on any other date within the shipment period specified in the notice of invitation to tender, the body responsible for payment shall extend the shipment period, by a maximum of 30 days. Where such an extension is not sufficient, the said body shall, upon agreement by the Commission, allow a further extension not exceeding 30 days. The successful tenderer shall be required to accept any extension which does not exceed 60 days from the end of the shipment period as specified in the notice of invitation to tender. At the end of a 60-day extension, the successful tenderer shall, at his request, be released from his obligations by the body concerned, which shall so inform the Commission immediately. In such cases the Commission shall take appropriate action. The costs arising from any extension to the shipment period shall be determined and paid in accordance with Article 24 (1). Article 18 In the case of supplies cif, the following shall apply: 1. The successful tenderer shall arrange for transport by the fastest usual sea route to the port of destination specified in the notice of invitation to tender and shall conclude a contract at his own expense, on the usual terms, for the carriage of the goods. Marine transport shall be in vessels meeting all the technical and health requirements for the transport of milk products. Vessels shall be not more than 15 years old in the case of transport by charter service and not more than 25 years old in the case of transport by liner service. In the event of default or of unsatisfactory transportation the successful tenderer shall, at the recipient's request, make all the necessary transport arrangements, including charter reservations. 2. The successful tenderer shall insure the goods and shall provide at his own expense a marine insurance policy endorsed to the order of the recipient. With the exception of cases of force majeure this policy shall cover all risks associated with carriage, transhipment, where appropriate, and unloading, including all cases of non-delivery and loss, without exclusion of particular average. The goods shall be insured for at least the amount of the tender increased by the amount of the security referred to, as the case may be, in Articles 4 (1) or 6 (1) (b), in the case of goods drawn from intervention stocks or goods manufactured therefrom, minus the refund applicable on the day when the insurance policy was taken out. 3. Where the goods are drawn from intervention stocks, the successful tenderer shall determine the schedule for their removal in agreement with the intervention agency concerned. 4. The successful tenderer shall communicate to the recipient and to the body responsible for payment the name of the vessel, the loading date and the expected date of arrival at the port of unloading, as soon as these particulars come to his knowledge. The body concerned shall immediately inform the Commission accordingly. In the case of transport by charter, the successful tenderer shall stipulate in the transport document that the captain must advise the recipient at least 72 hours in advance of the date of arrival at the port of unloading. 5. The successful tenderer shall bear the cost of loading the goods on board the vessel. He shall bear the freight and unloading charges, including wharfage and any lighterage charges. Where the goods are supplied in containers, the cost of unloading the goods from the containers shall not be charged to the successful tenderer. 6. Any demurrage at the port of unloading shall be charged to the successful tenderer. In exceptional circumstances these costs may be settled by the body concerned at its request, with the agreement of the Commission. 7.

If the recipient is not present at the time of shipment, the second subparagraph of Article 21 (2) shall apply. 8. The successful tenderer shall bear all the risks, in particular those of loss or deterioration, to which the goods are subject, until they have effectively passed the ship's rail at the port of shipment. Article 19 In the case of supplies free-at-destination, the following provisions shall apply: 1. The successful tenderer shall arrange for transport to the final destination by the fastest route and shall conclude the requisite contracts for the carriage of the goods. He shall bear all the costs relating thereto and the costs of unloading and placing them in a warehouse at the destination. He shall accordingly take out appropriate insurance cover. 2. Where the goods are drawn from intervention stocks, the successful tenderer shall determine the schedule for their removal in agreement with the intervention agency concerned. 3. The successful tenderer shall bear all the risks, and in particular those of loss or deterioration, to which the goods are subject until they have effectively been delivered and unloaded at the warehouse at their destination. 4. The successful tenderer shall, as soon as possible, notify the recipient of the date of loading, the means of transport used for forwarding the goods to their final destination and the expected date of arrival of the goods. He shall also communicate to the recipient the particulars specified in Article 20 (1) (a), (b) and (c).

For that purpose the successful tenderer shall hand over a list containing the following particulars: (a) the quantity, type, markings and numbers of the packages; (b) the gross and net weight of the goods; (c) where appropriate, the serial number of the control copy T No 5 referred to in Article 22 (2); (d) where appropriate, a copy of the control certificate referred to in Article 8 (3). 2. If, as a result of the checks referred to in paragraph 1, the recipient disputes the quality, quantity or packaging of the goods, the intervention agency of the country of shipment, in conjunction with the intervention agency or agencies concerned, shall arrange for a second check to be made before the loading of the goods at the port of shipment, and the results of this check shall be final. Any costs arising therefrom shall be borne by the losing party, including the costs entailed by failure to observe the period of shipment as specified in the notice of invitation to tenderer or as extended in accordance with Article 17 (5). 3. Where the decisive check reveals that the goods do not satisfy the requirements, the goods must be replaced by the successful tenderer. Where the quantity is deficient the successful tenderer shall make up the deficiency. Where the goods are drawn from intervention stocks or manufactured therefrom, the Commission shall, if necessary, take appropriate measures. Article 21 1. In the case of supplies fob and cif, a taking-over certificate shall be issued to the successful tenderer by the recipient immediately after the goods have been loaded at the port of shipment and, in the case of delivery cif, after the successful tenderer has furnished the bill of lading, the copy of the marine insurance policy and, where appropriate, the charter-party, in accordance with Article 18 (7). The taking-over certificate shall contain the details listed in Annex V. 2. Where the recipient fails to issue the certificate and provided that there is no dispute concerning the goods, the intervention agency of the country of shipment shall issue the successful tenderer with a certificate drawn up in accordance with Annex V, upon presentation of the supporting documents referred to in Article 20 (1) plus, in the case of supply cif, the bill of lading, the marine insurance policy and, where appropriate, the charterparty. In such cases, the intervention agency shall immediately forward the bill of lading, the marine insurance policy and, where appropriate, the charter-party to the Commission. These documents shall be sent by the Commission to the recipient. 3. In the case of supply free-at-destination, a taking-over certificate shall be issued by the recipient in accordance with the specimen in Annex V, immediately after the goods have been unloaded at the warehouse at their final destination. Where the recipient fails to issue the taking-over certificate and provided that there is no dispute concerning the goods, proof of supply may be furnished by means of a certificate drawn up in accordance with Annex V, endorsed by the Community delegate in the country of destination, or, failing this, by the embassy of one of the Member States of the Community. TITLE V SPECIAL RULES ON THE USE OF THE CONTROL COPY Article 22 Where the goods to be supplied are neither drawn from nor to be manufactured from products coming from intervention agency stocks, the following provisions shall apply: 1. The customs export formalities shall be completed in the Member State in which the tender was submitted. 2. Where the goods leave the geographical territory of the Community from a Member State other than that in which the customs export formalities were completed, the goods shall, from the time of completion of the said formalities until termination of the checks referred to in Article 8 (5), be accompanied by the control copy T No 5 referred to in Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 223/77. 3. The control copy T No 5 shall be issued only on production of the certificate referred to in Article 8 (3) ; this certificate shall be numbered and shall contain the following details: - a description of the goods as it should appear in box 41 of the control copy T No 5 and, where appropriate, any other information necessary for control purposes, - the quantity, type, markings and numbers of the packages, - the gross weight and the net weight of the goods, - a reference to this Regulation. A copy of this certificate shall be kept the customs office which issues the control copy T No 5. 4.

As regards the use of the control copy T No 5, Articles 8 and 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1687/76 shall apply mutatis mutandis to goods purchased on the Community market or goods manufactured therefrom. TITLE VI CONDITIONS FOR PAYMENT AND RELEASE OF SECURITIES Article 23 1. Payment to the successful tenderer shall be made in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 249/77 by the intervention agency to which the tenderer was submitted. 2. The amount to be paid shall be the amount tendered. However, in the case of goods purchased on the Community market or goods manufactured therefrom, the amount of the tender shall be corrected, where appropriate, to reflect the increase in the intervention price applicable to butter or skimmed-milk powder, expressed in the currency of the Member State in which the tender was submitted, between the final date for the submission of tenders and the date of issue of the certificate referred to in Article 8 (3). In the case of butteroil, the correction shall be calculated on the basis of the change in the intervention price for butter multiplied by a coefficient of 1,22 or 1,25, depending on whether the fat content of the butter used was at least 82 % or was less than 82 %. The successful tenderer may not claim payment under this provision until the seventh day after the entry into force of the new intervention prices and only if he furnishes proof that the basic product, whether butter or skimmed-milk powder, was manufactured after the entry into force of the new intervention prices. 3. The amount due shall be paid only on production of the following supporting documents: (a) the original of the taking-over certificate referred to in Article 21, drawn up by the recipient or by the intervention agency pursuant to Article 21 (2), or the certificate referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 21 (3); (b) where appropriate, the quality control certificate referred to in Article 8 (3); (c) in the case of goods drawn from intervention stocks or goods manufactured therefrom, the proof referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1687/76; (d) in the case of goods purchased on the Community market or goods manufactured therefrom, the control copy T No 5 referred to in Article 22 (2) to (5) or, if the destination has been checked only by the authorities of a single Member State, the proof of exportation required by that Member State; (e) in the case of supply cif, a copy of the bill of lading, the marine insurance policy, and, where appropriate, the charter party. 4. At the request of the successful tenderer, the body concerned may make payment proportional to the quantities of goods in respect of which the supporting documents listed above have been provided. 5. In the case of supply free-at-destination of goods bought on the Community market or goods manufactured therefrom, the body responsible for payment shall, at the request of the successful tenderer and on production of the supporting documents referred to in paragraph 3 (b) and (d), make a payment on account. However, such payment on account may not exceed 90 % of the sum payable. The payment on account shall be made only if the successful tenderer lodges, under the terms of Article 12 (2), a security equal to the payment on account plus 10 %. 6. In the case of supply fob or cif, the supporting documents referred to in paragraph 3 shall be submitted to the body responsible for payment within six months of the expiry date of the shipment period as specified in the notice of invitation to tender or as extended in accordance with Article 17 (5). In the case of supply free-at-destination, the supporting documents shall be submitted within nine months of the said expiry date. 7. If the supporting documents referred to in paragraph 3 are produced after the time limits laid down in paragraph 6, payment shall be made in full. Moreover, the provisions of Article 26 (4) shall apply. Article 24 1. In the case of supply fob, any costs arising as a result of the recipient's making the vessel available at a date which makes it impossible to observe the shipment period as specified in the notice of invitation to tender, having regard to the requirements laid down in Article 17 (3), or arising as a result of an extension of the shipment period in accordance with Article 17 (5), or arising from the fact that the vessel is unsuitable for the cargo, shall be determined by the body concerned and paid by the latter, upon agreement by the Commission, to the successful tenderer on production of supporting documents. Such additional costs shall be the following, excluding any administrative costs: - storage and insurance costs, - financing costs, on the basis of the rate obtaining in the Member State responsible for payment. Such costs shall be calculated for the period beginning on the day following the last day of the shipment period as specified in the notice of invitation to tender and ending either on the date on which loading is effectively commenced, or at the end of the period referred to in Article 17 (5) in the event that the successful tenderer is released from his obligations. 2. In the case of supply free-at-destination, the additional storage, insurance and financing costs entailed by delays not attributable to the successful tenderer of more than 15 days between delivery of the goods to the warehouse at their destination and the issue of the taking-over certificate by the recipient shall be reimbursed to the successful tenderer, on production of supporting documents, by the body responsible for payment, upon agreement by the Commission ; the additional financing costs shall be assessed on the basis of the rates obtaining in the Member State responsible for payment. 3. If, after the award has been made, the Commission designates a port of shipment, transhipment or unloading or a final destination other than those originally scheduled, the successful tenderer shall deliver the goods to the new port or new place of destination. The body concerned shall reach agreement with the successful tenderer, upon agreement by the Commission, on the decrease or increase in the amount to be paid as compared with the amount specified in the successful tender. By submitting a duly reasoned request, however, the successful tenderer may be released from his obligations by the body responsible for payment, which shall so inform the Commission immediately. In such cases, the Commission shall take appropriate action. 4. If the successful tenderer has had to bear, in respect of supply made pursuant to this Regulation, unforeseeable costs which could not be covered by insurance, he may have them taken over by the body responsible for payment on production of supporting documents and upon agreement by the Commission. Article 25 1. The successful tenderer shall bear all the financial consequences of a failure to supply some or all of the goods on the terms stipulated, if the recipient has made supply possible on such terms. If, for reasons attributable to the successful tenderer, shipment has not been made within three months of the expiry date of the shipment period as specified in the notice of invitation to tender or as extended in accordance with Article 17 (5), the body responsible for payment shall release the successful tenderer from his obligations. In such cases the Commission shall take appropriate action. 2. The costs arising from a failure to supply the goods as a result of a case of force majeure shall be borne by the body responsible for payment. Article 26 1. The tendering security referred to in Article 12 shall be released only where: (a) the tenderer did not withdraw his tender before the contract was awarded and where: - in the case referred to in the first indent of Article 12 (1), the delivery security provided for, as the case may be, in Article 4 (1) or 6 (1) (b) has been lodged in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1687/76, - in the case referred to in the second indent of Article 12 (1), the supporting documents referred to in Article 23 (3) have been forwarded to the body concerned; (b) the tender is not valid or has not been accepted, or where no contract has been awarded. 2.

The security referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 23 (5) shall be released as provided for in paragraph 4 only on production of a certificate as referred to in Article 23 (3) (a). 4. All securities shall be released as soon as the requisite supporting documents have been produced. The securities shall be forfeit if the supporting documents have not been produced within the time limits specified in Article 23 (6), subject to paragraphs 5 and 6. If, however, the supporting documents are produced after the prescribed time limits and within 24 months of the expiry date of the shipment period as specified in the notice of invitation to tender or as extended in accordance with Article 17 (5), 80 % of the securities in question shall be returned to the successful tenderer. 5. Where, for reasons attributable to the successful tenderer, the shipment period as specified in the notice of invitation to tender or as extended in accordance with Article 17 (5) has not been observed, the body concerned shall withhold, for each day's delay, in proportion to the quantities not shipped: - 1 % of the amount of the tendering security in the case of goods purchased on the Community market or goods manufactured therefrom, - 0,03 % of the amount of the delivery security in the case of goods drawn from intervention stocks or goods manufactured therefrom. 6. All the securities shall be forfeit in the event of the successful tenderer's being released from his obligations in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 25 (1). 7. At the request of the successful tenderer, the bodies concerned shall release the securities in proportion to the quantities of goods in respect of which the requisite supporting documents have been provided. 8. All the securities shall be released as soon as the successful tenderer is released from his obligations in accordance with Article 17 (5) or the second subparagraph of Article 24 (3). 9. Where the successful tenderer has been unable to fulfil his obligations because of circumstances recognized as a case of force majeure by the body responsible for payment, the securities shall be released immediately. Article 27 1. Where a case of force majeure occurs during the control period referred to in Article 8 (5), Article 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 1687/76 shall apply. 2. In any other case of force majeure, the body concerned shall decide on the measures which it considers necessary in the light of the circumstances involved and shall inform the Commission thereof without delay. TITLE VII FINAL PROVISIONS Article 28 No refund or compensatory amount, whether monetary or accession, shall be applied to skimmed-milk powder, butter or butteroil supplied as food aid. Article 29 1.

"Upsampling effectively does nothing. It just adds more samples between the already recorded samples. This shouldn't change the sound at all. Raising the bit rate just adds more zeros at to the sample but doesn't change the value. Downsampling is different. Let's say you record in 24bit/48k and you want to bounce a 16bit/44.1k CD mix. In some DAWs (Pro Tools for example) bouncing just truncates the bits and throws away samples based on some sort of algorithm. This causes a problem. Truncating bits creates what is called ""quantization error"" which in turn adds some nasty little noise to the mix. This raises the noise floor and effectively reduces the dynamic range of the mix even further than just recording in 16bit. To get around the quantization error, you must apply dither. Dither is noise but is ""good"" noise, it is very quiet and can be manipulated through psychoacoustic equalization or some other form of EQ to sound even quieter. Dither cancels out the harsh noise from quantization error and recreates a lot of the missing dynamic range. Dither lies at -90dB or lower btw, most people don't even hear it. If OP sees this, I think this may be your issue. Quantization error noise can really tear up a mix. If you are bouncing at a bit rate lower than you recorded, apply some dither. Put it on the stereo mix bus and DO NOT apply any gain modification after dither, make sure all automation and level adjustments occur before the dither. TL;DR: upsampling does nothing, downsampling creates quantization error. Also, DITHER RULES! I suggest reading about it in the Izotope Ozone manual. Those guys have awesome manuals.",informal
"Developers claim the 100MW project at Glenmuckloch, near Kirckconnel, could generate power for more than a century. It is the latest in a series of renewable energy schemes planned for the site, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates. They are part of a project to redevelop the opencast mine as Glenmuckloch Energy Park. The details have emerged in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council. Buccleuch Estates has joined with mining company Hargreaves and 2020 Renewables to draw up the plans. It will involve creating two reservoirs - one higher than the other - which will be connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine. The report states: ""When excess electricity exists within the grid the pump-turbines go into pumping mode lifting water to the upper pond and when demand within the network exceeds available supply the pump-turbines reverse and change to generating mode with water released from the upper pond."" If the project goes ahead, the lower reservoir will be created from the existing opencast void, while a second, upper pond will be excavated at the head of Halfmerk Hill. The higher reservoir will have a water depth of 22m (72 feet), creating 3.3million cubic metres of water storage. The redevelopment of Glenmuckloch follows the collapse of surface mining firm Aardvark TMC in 2013, leaving a shortfall in the money needed to restore the site to its pre-opencast condition. However since then Buccleuch Estates and Hargreaves have worked to implement a rolling programme of restoration in parallel with coaling operations. Later this summer two community wind turbines will be built to the west of the hydro site. Earlier this year plans for an eight turbine wind farm next to the mine were submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.",formal
"(CNN) -- The owner of a North Carolina beach house where seven college students died in a weekend fire said Monday that his family's ""lives were just changed forever"" by the tragedy. Chip Auman said his 18-year-old daughter survived the fire but was hospitalized and in stable condition because of complications from smoke inhalation. ""The thought of losing a child is unimaginable to me, and as a father my heart goes out to the families that lost a loved one in this situation,"" he said. Auman said the situation was ""hard to fathom."" ""There's just no words to describe what we've been going through,"" he said, asking for prayers for survivors and the families of those who died. ""We're numb, we're confused, we're heartbroken."" Two college campuses mourned Monday. Six University of South Carolina students and a Clemson University student died in the fire early Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. Six other South Carolina students were able to get out of the house in time. The six were treated and released from nearby Brunswick Community Hospital, but Auman's daughter was hospitalized again in Hartsville, South Carolina. Authorities from the state Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith said the house was ""engulfed"" in flames when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after being notified. The flames shot into the sky and ultimately left little more than portions of the framing. Fire officials do not believe foul play was involved. Watch a neighbor's video, fears of fast-burning fire » . Dennis A. Pruitt, the vice president for student affairs for the University of South Carolina, said investigators have said it would be Tuesday or Wednesday before the identities of the victims are confirmed publicly. It could be as much as a month until investigators know the cause of the fire, Pruitt said. The university did not cancel classes on Monday, but Pruitt said arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class at the 28,000-student campus. Pruitt said meetings had been held Sunday with members of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. The South Carolina students were affiliated with those houses, he said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. He also said counselors and ministers were available to help students deal with the loss of their classmates. The university president, Dr. Andrew Sorenson, contacted the families of those who died in the fire to express the condolences and support of the university community. Jay Laura, student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the campus would pull together after the tragedy. ""If any place can come together to help in the healing process and the aftermath of an event like this, it is South Carolina,"" Laura said at a Monday afternoon press conference. Fire survivor Tripp Wylie, a 20-year-old South Carolina sophomore, said he jumped out of a third-story window into a canal to escape the flames and was unable to get back in to help his friends. ""I could see a buddy of mine off to the left who had gotten out. He was just yelling at me to jump and stuff,"" Wylie told CNN affiliate WYFF. ""The smoke was pouring out, couldn't really breathe, so I had to make a quick decision. [I] just kind of leaned out the window and luckily I jumped far enough to make it into the canal."" Neighbors flocked to see the fire as firefighters battled and ultimately got the blaze under control. See the scenes of devastation » . George Smith, who lives across the street from the house, said he heard sirens between 6:30 and 7 a.m. and went outside to see ""the whole sky lit up."" ""The whole house was completely engulfed in flames, up to about 20 feet,"" he said. ""I have never seen [a fire] move so fast."" George Smith said the house's occupants were ""partying in there yesterday and into the night."" After about 10:30 p.m. Saturday they quieted down, he said. Linda Sing said she was walking her dog when she saw the fiery destruction. She noted that firefighters had saved an adjacent house by spraying it down with water. ""We knew there were people in there, but we hoped and prayed they'd gotten out,"" Sing said. ""This is the worst thing I've ever seen. We've had hurricanes, but this is worse.""

"There seems to be a lot of misinformation in this thread about dry ice, so I'll try to clear some things up: Dry ice is frozen CO2. When warmed up, CO2 'sublimates' from a solid straight to the gas we breathe every day. When placed in water, dry ice warms up very fast. So fast, that the sublimating CO2 forms bubbles of very cold CO2 gas in the water. When these bubbles reach the surface and the cold CO2 gas is released, it cools down the air around it causing water to condense into a fine mist. It is the condensed water vapor mist that is visible, and that the OP would like to use to visualize air flow. (independent source: Now then, would this work? Sort of. If you pass a small trail of mist into the case, you can see where the air is going based on how the mist moves through the case. It won't work very well however, because the mist needs to remain visible to do its job. First problem: case fans create a lot of turbulence. They'll chop up any stream of mist that travels through them pretty good, and blow it around on the other side. The second problem: air inside of a computer heats up. Remember that the mist stream was created by by cooling down water vapor in the air. Now, as that mist passes through the CPU or GPU, it gets heated back up and the mist goes away. Tl;dr: If you're lucky, you'll get a rough until the heat syncs. Second question: would it damage the hardware? In moderation, probably not. Water is not inherently bad for electronics. Pure water is a very poor conductor, and it's usually the salts and other dissolved minerals in water that damage electronics. Since most of the water in your dry-ice produced mist came from the air, it's relatively pure. There also isn't much of it: again, most of it came out of the air and there isn't much water vapor in the air to begin with. (Very little water comes from the dry ice's water supply because cold water doesn't evaporate well. The water level will drop because the ice sublimated.) Some of the water will condense inside of the case, but for a short time not enough that it should cause major problems. I say probably because computers can handle humidity pretty well, but don't expect the warranty to cover you if something goes wrong.",informal
"A new study by Cancer Research UK found that more than a third of Scots ate confectionary at least once a day. It warned that being overweight was the single biggest cause of preventable cancer after smoking. The Scottish government said it was committed to tackling obesity. Thirteen types of cancer, including bowel, breast and pancreatic, are linked to a person's weight, according to Cancer Research UK. The charity said its research revealed that 39% of Scots consumed confectionery at least once a day and almost a fifth (18%) of Scots have a soft drink which contained sugar at least once a day. About two-thirds (65%) of adults in Scotland and more than one quarter (28%) of children were found to be overweight or obese. The findings, for Cancer Research UK's Scale Down Cancer campaign, were based on a YouGov survey of 3,293 UK adults, 513 in Scotland, carried out between 24 February and 8 March 2016. Cancer Research UK is calling on the Scottish government to act to make it easier to shop healthily and improve the diets of Scots. The charity's cancer prevention expert Professor Linda Bauld, who is based at the University of Stirling, said: ""Scotland's sweet tooth is a huge worry for the health of the nation. ""Sugar should form no more than 5% of our diet but, on average, both adults and children in Scotland consume much more than this. ""Too much sugar in our diet can lead to weight gain - which is not just linked to cancer, but also the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and tooth decay. ""If left unchecked, obesity will lead to a rising tide in ill health, including cancers, and become a crippling burden on the NHS."" The charity said foods on promotion accounted for about 40% of all expenditure on food and drink consumed at home. It wants restrictions on supermarket multi-buy discounts on foods that are high in sugar, fat and salt to form part of measures in the expected Scottish government strategy to improve diets. The charity said half (52%) of adults in Scotland had a ready meal once a week or more and 16% eat fast food or a takeaway at least once a week. Prof Bauld added: ""The Scottish government can, and must, do more to make it easier to shop healthily and serve up a better future for our young people. We need urgent action now to prevent thousands of cancers in the future."" Food Standards Scotland said it supported the charity's call for action but it cautioned that there was no ""single silver bullet"" to Scotland's obesity problem. Its head of nutrition science and policy, Heather Peace, said: ""We all need to recognise there is a problem and everyone, including consumers, the food and drink industry, retailers, media and government has a part to play in finding a solution."" Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said: ""We are committed to tackling Scotland's obesity problems and will consult on our new diet and obesity strategy this year, building on our wide range of activity to make it easier for people to be more active, eat less and eat better. ""We're investing Â£12m over five years to 2017 on a range of programmes to specifically tackle the nation's poor diet, including engaging with the food and drink industry on action to offer healthier choices, rebalance promotions, and reformulate products with a focus on reducing calories, salt, fats and added sugar.""",formal

In a statement, Ineos said its investment would boost the amount of ethylene it can produce at each plant in Grangemouth and Rafnes by about 50%, to more than one million tonnes.

"The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the death penalty of Pakistani national Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab, the sole surviving gunman of the 2008 attacks on Mumbai, has opened the debate once again. Predictably, the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been quick to demand Qasab's swift execution ""as those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy"". Qasab can still appeal to the highest court to review the verdict; and his last hope lies with a plea for clemency to the president. His appalling crime of gunning down innocents surely qualifies as a ""rarest of the rare crime"", a condition for handing out the death penalty in India. But, as critics of capital punishment say, there's no evidence to show that the death penalty deters crime. Two-thirds of the world's countries have done away with the death penalty in law or in practice. Last year, according to Amnesty International, death sentences were imposed in 63 countries, but only 21 countries actually carried out executions. India has shied away from executing people for many years now. There have been only two hangings in the country in the past 12 years and the majority of convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. Former president Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts midway through her five-year term. Clemency pleas of 29 prisoners on death row in India are pending before the president. They include Afzal Guru, who was convicted for carrying out an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. The Supreme Court upheld his death sentence as long ago as 2004. Then there is a serious practical problem: there are only one or two hangmen available in India. Two years ago, I met one in a Calcutta prison who had been employed as a hangman-cum-sweeper, and was still waiting to carry out his first execution. Recently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president asking him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates being held in prisons across the country. And the Supreme Court itself recently admitted that some death penalties it had upheld were erroneous. ""Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolition of the death penalty,"" says AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court in an interview in today's The Times of India.

"The former Tory prime minister also called for ""more charm and a lot less cheap rhetoric"" from the UK government towards the rest of the EU. And he said the costs of leaving would be ""substantial"" and ""unpalatable"". Downing Street said the government was determined to make a success of the UK's departure from the EU. Conservative former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said it was a ""peculiar speech in the sense that it looked backwards the whole time"". He told BBC Newsnight: ""It was almost like a re-fight of the referendum... strangely bitter really, and almost really the speech of someone who simply refuses to accept that the British people should have made a decision such as they did."" Prime Minister Theresa May plans to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins two years of formal negotiations, by the end of March. She has already confirmed the UK will not remain a member of the EU single market but will instead seek a new free trade deal with the remaining members. In a speech in London, Sir John, who campaigned for a Remain vote in June's referendum, claimed there was ""little chance"" the advantages of being part of the EU single market could be replicated once the UK leaves. ""I have watched with growing concern as the British people have been led to expect a future that seems to be unreal and over-optimistic,"" he said. ""Obstacles are brushed aside as of no consequence, whilst opportunities are inflated beyond any reasonable expectation of delivery."" For Theresa May, also an unflashy leader who was propelled to No 10 by a surprising political moment, Europe will be defining in a way no others could even have anticipated. In Sir John's carefully calibrated speech, there are plenty of messages for her, some of which may be welcome, some not. First off, having campaigned to stay in the European Union, with sober warnings particularly about the consequences for the Northern Irish peace process, it's no surprise that Sir John says that in his view, Brexit will be a ""historic mistake"". It is notable, although again not surprising, that he cautions that the UK will be a diminished diplomatic force in the world after we walk away from the EU, with a warning too that we will be less useful to our most important ally, the US, as a consequence. Also, even as the PM who lived through the Commons trauma of trying to deliver the Maastricht Treaty, it is logical that he calls for Parliament to have a full role in shaping the negotiations over our place in Europe. What may be harder for No 10 to dismiss is Sir John's obvious political concern about how the public is being treated in the months after the referendum decision. Read more from Laura Sir John said Brexit talks require ""statesmanship of a high order"" and warned of a ""real risk"" of the exit deal falling ""well below the hopes and expectations"" that have been raised, saying he doubted the ""rosy confidence being offered to the British people"". ""In my own experience, the most successful results are obtained when talks are conducted with goodwill: it is much easier to reach agreement with a friend than a quarrelsome neighbour. ""Behind the diplomatic civilities, the atmosphere is already sour. A little more charm, and a lot less cheap rhetoric, would do much to protect the UK's interests."" He also said the ""cheerleaders"" for Brexit had shown a ""disregard that amounts to contempt"" towards those that backed the losing side. And he said the UK would become ""far more dependent"" on the US after it leaves the EU, describing President Donald Trump as ""less predictable, less reliable and less attuned to our free market and socially liberal instincts than any of his predecessors"". Sir John, who as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 oversaw the start of the Northern Ireland peace process, warned that ""uncertainties over border restrictions"" after Brexit were ""a serious threat to the UK, to the peace process and for Ireland, North and South"". The ex-PM, who faced battles with Eurosceptic MPs during his time in Downing Street, also said Mrs May would have to ""face down"" people calling for ""total disengagement"" from Europe. But the Leave Means Leave campaign hit back, recalling Sir John's famous ""don't bind my hands"" plea to Tory Eurosceptics ahead of EU talks and saying he was now ""seeking to do just this to the British prime minister ahead of negotiations with the EU"". Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg added: ""It was a craven and defeated speech of a bitter man who was heavily defeated by the electorate for his own failings in Europe in 1997, was defeated again last June and now wishes to take out his failures on Mrs May.""",formal

"But the Premier League club say they want Allardyce to stay, insisting he is ""very much key to our plans"". Sunderland claim speculation about Allardyce has been ""extremely damaging"" and have urged the FA to ""bring about a swift resolution to the matter"". England are searching for a new boss after Roy Hodgson quit on 28 June. He resigned after the national team were knocked out of Euro 2016 at the last-16 stage by Iceland. Photographs that appeared to show Allardyce, 61, at the home of FA vice-chairman David Gill were published in the media in the past 24 hours. Allardyce had been on tour with Sunderland in Austria until he returned home at the start of the week, reportedly on transfer business. Sunderland said they agreed to let Allardyce speak with the FA as a ""potential candidate"" after he requested permission, but are upset discussions did not remain confidential. ""After what was an extremely challenging season, we are keen to see a period of stability, both on and off the field, and we want him to remain as manager of our football club,"" read a club statement issued on Wednesday. Kevin Davies, who played under Allardyce at Bolton, thinks his former boss would be a good choice for England. ""Where we are now as a nation, I think he is probably the right man,"" said Davies, who earned one England cap during his career. ""Motivation-wise, he is fantastic, the best I have ever worked with. He knows how to get the best out of a player. ""He has a lot of other strengths, too. He surrounds himself with the best people in the best roles, which allows him to plan and get the best out of his squad."" Davies also thinks Allardyce will improve morale in the dressing room. ""The atmosphere he will create will be similar to Wales or Iceland... that spirit, that togetherness, along with the ability that we have a lacked,"" said Davies. ""I think he has always thrived on being the underdog and I think England are going to go into a lot of games as underdogs in the future, so it probably will suit the way England are at the moment. "" Allardyce is not the only Premier League manager linked with the England job. Arsenal's Arsene Wenger, Bournemouth's Eddie Howe and Hull City's Steve Bruce have all been touted as possible candidates. United States boss Jurgen Klinsmann and former England manager Glenn Hoddle have also been linked with the job, but Allardyce is the frontrunner. The former West Ham, Newcastle, Bolton and Blackburn boss, who has one year left on his Sunderland contract, won a lot of plaudits for keeping the Black Cats in the Premier League last season. England begin their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign on 4 September, when they face Slovakia in Trnava. The two sides met at Euro 2016, battling out a goalless draw in Group B. Media playback is not supported on this device The England manager will be chosen by a three-man panel - Gill, FA technical director Dan Ashworth and chief executive Martin Glenn. They want the next boss to be a strong-minded, tactically savvy manager who will build a clear team identity and help shape the team into a cohesive unit. Allardyce was previously interviewed for the role in 2006 after Sven-Goran Eriksson left following that year's World Cup. Eriksson's assistant Steve McClaren got the job instead but he failed to guide England to qualification for the 2008 European Championship. Here's what Allardyce has since said about the England job: 2009 After missing out to McClaren: ""I should have got it and I really don't know why I didn't. It had to be political for me, rather than my credentials. ""Maybe my external look isn't to everybody's liking. It was the right time and the right job for me but not from the FA's point of view. ""It seems foreign coaches are still all the craze for the top jobs and that is a great shame. I also think that Steve not being successful was a massive blow for British or English managers, because it has put us down a peg or two."" 2015 From his autobiography: ""I wanted to do a real knock-your-socks-off interview for the FA, so I put together a PowerPoint which looked at every single detail. ""Nobody but nobody was going to beat it. But then Brian Barwick, the chief executive, told me there were no PowerPoint facilities at the interview venue, so I had to print off hard copies for the panel. So much for the progressive FA. ""I should have got it and, as I'm a better manager now than I was then, I believe I should be in the running whenever it comes round again. That's not vanity or being full of my own importance. My track record entitles me to be considered."" May 2016 Prior to Euro 2016: ""That's gone. For me to be interested in the England job, Roy would probably have to leave at the end of the Euros. ""And would England be interested in me? They say they are looking for an English manager, but will they do it? You've got this, 'what's sexier?' element now, rather than how good you are at doing the job.""",formal

"Commission Regulation (EC) No 403/2004 of 4 March 2004 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(2), and in particular Article 1(2) and Article 3(1) thereof, Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation. (2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends. (4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded. (5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68. (6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price. (7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed. (8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation. (9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 The representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.

"LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters) -- ""To insure or not to insure?"" It isn't Shakespeare, but it is the dramatic question Hollywood filmmakers are asking about Lindsay Lohan following her legal troubles this week. Lindsay Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled, but the cost will be high. It is an important question, too, because whether companies insure Lohan's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off Hollywood's A-list. But Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable, say underwriting experts. While some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars, experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison, even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost. ""For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just won't be interested,"" said Ross Miller, partner with insurance brokerage D.R. Reiff & Associates Inc. Lohan's arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress, who shot to fame as a child in Disney films like ""The Parent Trap,"" is too risky to cast in a film. Timeline: Lindsay Lohan's troubles » . It remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in ""Poor Things,"" a film produced by and starring Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine. See a gallery of Lohan's films » . A statement was expected early next week on whether the movie, already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by Lohan, will proceed with or without her. Insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations, although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of Lohan and fellow troubled party girls Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. ""I don't think it (a problematic artist) is any more of an issue,"" said Wendy Diaz, entertainment underwriting director at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the leading film underwriter. ""It's pretty standard year to year."" But Diaz did say the terms for covering Lohan would likely be ""serious at this point."" She said Fireman's Fund, in such a case, would likely put in higher deductibles, or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted. Last July, a producer on Lohan's last film, ""Georgia Rule,"" scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set, costing the movie's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Brian Kingman, a managing director with entertainment insurance broker Aon/Albert G. Ruben said covering situations like Lohan's required a lot of calculation and risk management. Insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie's production budget, which can range from $5 million to $100 million or more, he said. ""Filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk,"" Kingman said. He said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance. In certain circumstances, drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples. In cases of known drug abuse, ""minders"" are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor. Kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration. ""I have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules,"" he said, citing the case of Robert Downey Jr., another high-profile star with a history of legal, drug and alcohol problems.

"AMMAN, Jordan (CNN) -- In the sunbathed schoolyard of the Shmisani Institute for Girls in Amman, Jordan, principal Sanaa Abu Harb makes an announcement over the speaker system. Iraqi students at the Shmisani school in Amman gather around a teacher. One in 5 students there is Iraqi. ""All Iraqi girls come outside now. All Iraqi girls. Iraqi girls only!"" she repeats several times, making sure the message is clear and waving away Jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion. Dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground. Harb wants the CNN crew to see how many Iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating. This school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list. Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home » . The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools. Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. ""We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our students,"" she says. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. Seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement. Eighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. Matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare, he repeats the number: ""Five members."" Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation, but also their entry into the workforce. All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones. ""It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know,"" says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. ""I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them."" He pauses: ""But you have to miss your country."" The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age Iraqi children are in Jordan. Many of them are enrolled in private institutions. But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms. As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records. Regardless of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. ""Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education,"" says Touqan, the education minister. ""We will not run a parallel system of education.""

To take account of the new arrangements and of past experience, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1725/79 of 26 July 1979 on the rules for granting aid to skimmed milk processed into compound feedingstuffs and skimmed-milk powder intended for feed for calves(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 83/96(7), should be amended and, where necessary, simplified. At the same time as amending that Regulation, in the interests of clarity, it should also be recast to incorporate Commission Regulations (EEC) No 3398/91 of 20 November 1991 on the sale by invitation to tender of skimmed-milk powder for the manufacture of compound feedingstuffs and amending Regulation (EEC) No 569/88(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 124/1999(9), and (EEC) No 1634/85 of 17 June 1985 fixing the amount of the aid for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder for use as feed(10), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1802/95; (2) the goal of the aid measure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 is to enable the best return to be obtained from milk proteins. It is therefore appropriate to link payment of the aid to the milk-protein content of the skimmed milk or skimmed-milk powder used; (3) it is necessary to ensure that the skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder for which aid is granted are in fact used as feed. To that end, aid should be granted only for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder processed into compound feedingstuffs or denatured in accordance with certain requirements. It is also necessary to prevent aid being paid more than once for the same product; (4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/97(11) derogates from some of the monitoring provisions in Regulation (EEC) No 1725/79. The checks provided for in this Regulation should take that derogation into account and Regulation (EC) No 1043/97 should be repealed; (5) aid should be granted only if the compound feedingstuffs meet certain minimum standards as regards composition customarily observed in the industry and if they have reached the final stage of industrial manufacture. For inspection purposes, the products should be packaged in a way that enables them to be identified. Member States should be allowed to specify how the above requirements are to be satisfied; (6) special packing is not necessary for compound feedingstuffs which have had lucerne meal added to them. Furthermore, such a requirement would not be appropriate in cases of transportation by tanker or container as practised by certain users. That method of transport should therefore be subject to special inspection arrangements and aid should be paid only after inspection; (7) the final use of cut-price skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder can be monitored only if the undertakings benefiting from aid offer adequate guarantees. Processing undertakings should be approved by the competent agency of the Member State concerned and have an accounting system adapted to the requirements of the aid arrangements; (8) as regards the reference methods applicable to the analyses provided for in this aid scheme, reference should be made to the list published each year under Commission Regulation (EC) No 2721/95 of 24 November 1995 establishing rules for the application of reference and routine methods for the analysis and quality evaluation of milk and milk products under the common market organisation(12). However, since no reference methods have been laid down for determining the quantity of skimmed-milk powder in compound feedingstuffs, the presence of rennet whey powder in skimmed-milk powder or the quality of starch in skimmed-milk powder, the appropriate methods should be laid down in this Regulation; (9) a standing invitation to tender should be organised for the sale of skimmed-milk powder from public stocks, in order to ensure equality of access for all potential purchasers, to arrive at a selling price reflecting market conditions and to verify the actual end use of skimmed-milk powder intended for use in the manufacture of compound feedingstuffs. The prices offered can differ considerably according, in particular, to the age of the powder offered for sale and its location. It should therefore be possible to fix differentiated minimum prices; (10) this Regulation should set the time limit for entry into storage for the purposes of sale. Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3536/91 of 2 December 1991 setting the latest time of entry into storage for skimmed-milk powder sold under Regulation (EEC) No 3398/91(13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2508/1999(14), should therefore be repealed; (11) the arrangements laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1105/68 of 27 July 1968 on detailed rules for granting aid for skimmed milk for use as feed(15), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1802/95, have proved difficult to implement and checks on beneficiaries are problematic. Moreover, the quantities of skimmed milk benefiting from this measure have fallen sharply in recent years, so that the scheme now has only a marginal impact on the balance on the market in milk products. In addition, the market in skimmed milk will continue to be supported by the aid granted when skimmed milk is incorporated into compound feedingstuffs. The aid measure provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1105/68 should therefore be abolished and the said Regulation repealed; (12) the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 This Regulation lays down detailed rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards: (a) the grant of aid for skimmed milk, skimmed-milk powder, buttermilk and buttermilk powder intended for use as animal feed under Article 11 of that Regulation; (b) the sale of skimmed-milk powder intended for use as animal feed under Article 7(4) of that Regulation. Article 2 For the purposes of this Regulation: (a) ""Milk"" means the product obtained from milking one or more cows, to which nothing has been added and which has at most been only partially skimmed; (b) ""Skimmed milk"" means milk with a fat content of no more than 1 % and a protein content of not less than 31,4 % of the non-fatty dry extract; (c) ""Skimmed-milk powder"" means the product obtained by removing the water from milk, with a maximum fat content of 11 %, a maximum moisture content of 5 % and a protein content of not less than 31,4 % of the non-fatty dry extract; (d) ""Buttermilk"" means the by-product of butter manufacture obtained after churning the cream and separating the solid fat, with a maximum fat content of 1 % and a protein content of not less than 31,4 % of the non-fatty dry extract; (e) ""Buttermilk powder"" means the product obtained by removing the water from buttermilk, with a maximum fat content of 11 %, a maximum moisture content of 5 % and a protein content of not less than 31,4 % of the non-fatty dry extract. Article 3 For the purposes of applying this Regulation, buttermilk and buttermilk powder shall be treated as skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder, respectively. Article 4 ""Mixtures intended for the manufacture of compound feedingstuffs"" (hereinafter called ""mixtures"") means products containing the following ingredients: (a) skimmed-milk powder; (b) fat; (c) vitamins; (d) minerals; (e) sucrose; (f) anti-caking agents and/or free-flowing agents (maximum 0,3 %); (g) other liposoluble technical agents, including anti-oxidants and emulsifiers. Article 5 1. ""Compound feedingstuffs"" means products: (a) which contain, per 100 kilograms of finished product, (i) not less than 50 kilograms and not more than 80 kilograms of skimmed-milk powder, and (ii) not less than 5 kilograms of non-butter fats and at least 2 kilograms of starch or puffed starch, or (iii) not less than 2,5 kilograms of non-butter fats and at least 2 kilograms of starch or puffed starch in cases where 5 kilograms of lucerne meal or grass meal containing at least 50 % (m/m) of particles not exceeding 300 microns are incorporated per 100 kilograms of skimmed-milk powder. The particles not exceeding 300 microns must be uniformly distributed in the mixture; (b) which can be used directly as feed and which will not be processed or mixed before they reach the end user. 2. Where it is established that the manufactured product contains a quantity of skimmed-milk powder exceeding the maximum quantity of 80 kilograms referred to in paragraph 1 (a)(i) but not exceeding 81 kilograms, the aid may nevertheless be granted on the basis of a skimmed-milk powder content of 80 kilograms. Where the manufactured product does not contain the minimum quantity of 50 kilograms of skimmed-milk powder referred to in paragraph 1 (a)(i), aid minus 15 % shall be granted for the skimmed-milk powder actually incorporated provided that the skimmed-milk powder content is equal to at least 45 kilograms per 100 kilograms of finished product. Article 6 1. ""Denatured skimmed-milk powder"" means products manufactured in accordance with one of the following formulae: (a) Formula A: 100 kilograms of skimmed-milk powder, plus: (i) at least 9 kilograms of lucerne meal or grass meal containing at least 50 % (m/m) of particles not exceeding 300 microns, and (ii) at least 2 kilograms of starch or puffed (pregelatinised) starch; (b) Formula B: 100 kilograms of skimmed-milk powder, plus: (i) at least 5 kilograms of lucerne meal or grass meal containing at least 50 % (m/m) of particles not exceeding 300 microns, and (ii) at least 12 kilograms of fish meal, non-deodorised or with a strong smell, containing at least 30 % (m/m) of particles not exceeding 300 microns, and (iii) at least 2 kilograms of starch or puffed (pregelatinised) starch. The particle sizes which, according to BS standard 410-1976, are the closest to the maximum sizes laid down for the particles of the product concerned, without being smaller than them, shall be regarded as equivalent thereto. 2. The substances added to the skimmed-milk powder must be uniformly distributed in the mixture. Skimmed-milk powder may not be put through any process, either before or after denaturing, that will weaken or neutralise the effects of the denaturing, in particular by using deodorising agents, changing the taste and smell by eliminating the components responsible for gustatory and/or olfactory perception, or adding ingredients giving a taste and smell that mask those of the fish meal.

The information listed in paragraph 1 shall be supported by delivery vouchers and invoices. 3. Member States may require undertakings to keep specific stock accounts showing, in particular, any additional information they deem necessary to facilitate application of this Regulation. Article 15 In order to ensure compliance with this chapter, the Member States shall carry out, in particular, the inspections provided for in Articles 16 to 18. The agency responsible for inspection shall record the results of the inspections in reports containing, in particular, the information provided for in Annex I to this Regulation. Article 16 1. Subject to paragraph 2, as regards compliance with the protein, moisture and fat content of the skimmed milk or skimmed-milk powder incorporated, the inspection shall be made before, or at the latest at the time of, their use, whether unaltered or in the form of a mixture, in the manufacture of compound feedingstuffs or their use unaltered in the manufacture of denatured skimmed-milk powder. 2. Where the skimmed-milk powder used, whether unaltered or in a mixture, comes directly from the factory premises in which it is produced, the inspection referred to in paragraph 1 may be made before the powder leaves the said factory premises. In that case, the following rules shall apply: (a) the inspecting agency concerned shall take all necessary action to ensure that the quantity of skimmed-milk powder checked is actually used in the manufacture of compound feedingstuffs or denatured skimmed-milk powder; (b) the sacks, packaging and containers in which the skimmed-milk powder is put up shall bear the relevant information identifying the powder and the factory premises and shall show the date of manufacture, the net weight and the protein, moisture and fat content of the powder; (c) the inspection records drawn up by the inspecting agency must: (i) identify the skimmed-milk powder and state, in particular, the quantity of powder, its protein, moisture and fat content and the date of manufacture, (ii) accompany the skimmed-milk powder until it is incorporated into compound feedingstuffs, (iii) be annexed to the records referred to in Article 14(1). Article 17 1. The arrangements for inspecting the use of skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder, whether unaltered or in a mixture, in the manufacture of compound feedingstuffs, shall be determined by the Member State concerned and must fulfil at least the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 to 5. 2. Inspection of the undertakings concerned shall cover, in particular: (a) the composition of the skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder used unaltered; (b) the composition of mixtures used; (c) the composition of the compound feedingstuffs manufactured. 3. Inspection of undertakings shall take place on the premises and shall relate in particular to the manufacturing conditions as established by: (a) inspecting the raw materials used; (b) checking incoming and outgoing products; (c) sampling; (d) checking the records referred to in Article 14(1). 4. Inspections shall be unannounced and shall be made at least once in every 14 days of manufacture. Their frequency shall be determined on the basis of the quantities of skimmed-milk powder used by the undertaking and the frequency with which its accounts are scrutinised under paragraph 5. Undertakings not constantly using skimmed milk or skimmed-milk powder shall forward their manufacturing programme to the inspecting agency of the Member State concerned so that the latter may arrange the corresponding inspections. The above inspection frequency shall not apply in cases where the manufacture of compound feedingstuffs is the subject of continuous inspection on the premises. 5. The inspections referred to in paragraph 4 shall be supplemented by thorough and unannounced scrutiny of commercial documents and of the records referred to in Article 14(1). Such scrutiny shall be carried out at least once every 12 months. Where it is carried out at least once every three months, the frequency of the inspections referred to in paragraph 3 may be reduced from at least once in every 14 days to at least once in every 28 days of manufacture. Article 18 1. The manufacture of denatured skimmed-milk powder shall be inspected on the premises at least once a day during the denaturing operation. 2.

The aid shall be paid on the basis of applications submitted by manufacturers of compound feedingstuffs or denatured skimmed-milk powder (hereinafter called ""beneficiaries"") to the competent authority, indicating: (a) the name and address of the beneficiary; (b) the quantity of skimmed milk or skimmed-milk powder for which aid is requested, indicating the protein content; (c) where applicable, the quantity of compound feedingstuffs into which the skimmed milk or skimmed-milk powder referred to at (b) is incorporated, indicating any relevant manufacturing batch numbers. 4. The aid shall be paid at intervals to be fixed by the Member State, but the period covered by the payment application may not exceed one month. Article 23 1. Payment of the aid shall be subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 to 4. 2. The results of the analyses provided for in this chapter and the checks referred to in Article 15 relating to the payment period immediately prior to that for which the aid is requested must show that the provisions of this chapter have been complied with. 3. Beneficiaries must show to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the corresponding quantity of skimmed milk or skimmed-milk powder has been processed into compound feedingstuffs or denatured during the period covered by the aid application. 4. In cases covered by Article 12, beneficiaries shall supply supporting documents establishing to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the compound feedingstuffs have actually been delivered by tanker or container to a farm or breeding or fattening concern which uses such feedingstuffs. Article 24 1. Without prejudice to Article 25, if the results of the analyses provided for in this chapter and the checks referred to in Article 15 show that the applicant has not complied with this chapter during the previous payment period, payment of the aid for the period covered by the current application shall be suspended pending the results of the checks made during the period in question. In addition, any aid unduly paid for the previous period concerned shall be recovered. 2. The amount of aid unduly paid out shall be that paid for all the skimmed milk or skimmed-milk powder used during the period between the date of the last inspection giving rise to no observations and the date of the inspection indicating that the beneficiary is again complying with this Regulation. However, if the beneficiary so requests, the authority responsible for inspections shall carry out a special enquiry as soon as possible, at the former's expense. If the quantity is shown to be less than that referred to in the first subparagraph, the amount to be recovered shall be adjusted accordingly. Article 25 Where the condition laid down in Article 23(3) is met, Member States shall be authorised to pay an advance, within the meaning of Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85(18), for an amount equal to the amount of aid applied for, subject to the lodging of a security equal to 110 % of the amount of the advance. In this case, the supporting documents proving entitlement to the aid shall be supplied within six months following payment of the advance.

If the full quantity available is not allocated, the remainder shall be awarded to the other tenderers on the basis of the prices tendered, starting with the highest price. 4. Where acceptance of a tender would result in contracts being awarded in excess of the quantity of skimmed-milk powder available in a particular warehouse, only the quantity available shall be awarded to the tenderer in question. However, the intervention agency may designate other warehouses to make up the quantity set out in the tender, provided the tenderer agrees. 5. Where acceptance of two or more tenders offering the same price for skimmed-milk powder in a particular warehouse would lead to contracts being awarded in excess of the quantity available, the award shall be made by allocating the quantity available in proportion to the quantities tendered for. However, should such allocation lead to the award of quantities of less than five tonnes, the award shall be made by drawing lots. Article 33 Rights and obligations arising in connection with the invitation to tender shall not be transferable. Article 34 1. The intervention agency shall immediately inform tenderers of the outcome of their participation in the invitation to tender. Securities as referred to in Article 29 lodged for unsuccessful tenders shall be released immediately. 2. Before removing the skimmed-milk powder and within the period specified in Article 35(2), successful tenderers shall pay the intervention agency the amount corresponding to their tender for each quantity that they wish to withdraw and shall lodge the processing tender provided for in Article 30(3). Article 35 1. Once the amount referred to in Article 34(2) has been paid and the security provided for in Article 30(3) has been lodged, the intervention agency shall release the tendering security referred to in Article 29 and issue a removal order indicating: (a) the quantity in respect of which the abovementioned requirements have been met; (b) the warehouse in which the skimmed-milk powder is in store; (c) the final date for removal of the skimmed-milk powder; (d) the final date for processing into compound feedingstuffs or denaturing. 2.

"(CNN) -- The chief operating officer of the National Children's Museum was arrested Tuesday and is charged with distributing child pornography over the Internet, authorities said. Robert A. Singer is accused of sending images depicting child pornography to people he believed to be a 12-year-old girl and her 33-year-old mother, according to a statement issued by U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia of the Southern District of New York. In reality he was communicating with an undercover detective for the New York Police Department. Some of the pornographic images were sent from Singer's computer at the museum, according to an affidavit filed in support of the charges by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. The Washington museum posted a message on its Web site saying officials there are ""horrified"" by news of Singer's arrest. They reported that he has been suspended from his post, effective immediately, and is barred from the property. Singer, 49, was arrested at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, by federal agents, according to the prosecutors' statement. Authorities allege he engaged in several instant messaging ""chats"" and e-mail communications with the undercover detective, posing as the woman and her daughter, from August to September. He is charged with five counts of distributing child pornography in interstate commerce. If convicted on each count, he would face a sentence of up to 140 years in prison -- up to 20 years for the first count and up to 40 years for each additional count, prosecutors said. Singer allegedly initiated contact with the undercover detective, posing as the mother, in an America On Line chat room called ""Cuties."" The chat room attracts people who ""are known to trade in pornographic images, including child pornography,"" according to an affidavit filed in the case by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""On five separate occasions in August 2007, Singer sent several images of child pornography over the Internet to the mother and the daughter, including images depicting sexual acts between minors and adults and images depicting known victims of child exploitation,"" prosecutors said. In his communications with the supposed daughter, Singer pretended to be a 15-year-old boy, authorities said. In August 2007, he sent her two images featuring child pornography, according to the affidavit, with the instruction, ""just delete it when you are done."" A search of Singer's AOL account activity showed that from July to September, he sent about 80 images featuring child pornography to people including the detective, authorities said in the statement. Also, the search revealed that he had received about 10 images and one video depicting child pornography. Singer was expected to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge later Tuesday. He is identified in the complaint as a spokesman for the National Children's Museum, but a spokeswoman who asked not to be identified said he was promoted to chief operating officer within the past few months. He has been employed by the museum for four years, she said. In a written statement, the museum said it was notified by the Department of Homeland Security and ICE of Singer's arrest. ""We are horrified by the charges,"" the statement said. ""This news is deeply upsetting to the National Children's Museum family."" ""As its essence, the National Children's Museum is about enriching the lives of children,"" the statement said. ""We are educators, child advocates and parents.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Twelve-year-old Mohammed Rasoul, his right leg severed below the knee, maneuvers on crutches over the dirt and loose stones through the Falluja graveyard. Mohammed Rasoul sitting with his mother, Jinan Khalifa, eagerly awaits his trip to the United States. Row after row of headstones stand as the deadly reminder of the tragedy the city went through as insurgents battled for control of the city. Mohammed stops at his cousin's grave. ""I feel an ache when I think of her. Every time I remember her, I cry,"" he told CNN at a visit to the grave a few months ago. As he spoke, he poured water on a tree he planted next to it. The headstone reads: ""Martyr 643, the child Hajer Ismael Khalil, 13 October 2006."" Clutching her photograph, Mohammed says, ""My cousin died on the scene. I still remember her screams."" The same explosion cost him his leg and his childhood. ""A car came out of nowhere. My cousin was playing with her friend,"" he says. ""I remember [the car] was green. It detonated."" Watch Mohammed tell his story » . His mother, Jinan Khalifa, remembers that day all too well. She was in the kitchen when she heard a deafening explosion. ""There was shattered glass from the windows falling all over us. I went outside and saw my son covered in blood from head to toe,"" she says. Her son endured 11 operations before doctors amputated his leg below the knee. Khalifa says her son put forward a tough face, but when he finally went back home the shock hit him. ""That's where his personality started to change. He stopped laughing,"" she says. ""It was tearing me up,"" Mohammed says ""It was hard for me to watch others play. And I couldn't, I couldn't walk, it agitated me."" CNN first broadcast his story in May where it caught the attention of an American charity, the Global Medical Relief Fund, which offered to help. ""I cannot put my feelings into words,"" Khalifa says. ""An entire book would not be enough. They gave my son his hope back. The America we knew was one that came, bombed, harmed.

Suppressed under Soviet rule, the main religion, Islam, is undergoing a revival.

Born in 1940, Mr Nazarbayev came to power in 1989 as first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and was elected president the following year. He was re-elected after the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, and since then another four times - practically unopposed - most recently in 2015. He remains popular among many ordinary Kazakhs. His supporters say he preserved inter-ethnic accord and stability during the reform in the 1990s, and is widely credited for the country's impressive economic growth in first decade of the new millennium. Mr Nazarbayev has concentrated extensive powers in his own hands and is accused by the opposition of suppressing dissent. He says democracy is a long-term goal, but that stability could be at risk if change is too swift. Most media outlets are controlled or influenced by members of the president's family, including his daughter and her husband, and other powerful groups. Many of the 1,000-plus newspaper titles are government-run and the state controls printing presses. There are 250 TV and radio stations, according to official figures. The government operates national networks. Russian stations are carried via cable and satellite.

"(CNN) -- Muddy but unhurt, three University of Texas students emerged from a cramped cave complex in Austin, Texas, after a day-long search Sunday. A rescuer at the entrance to Airman's Cave in Austin, Texas, Sunday. Lt. Matt Cox, an Austin Fire Department spokesman, said the students -- two women and one man -- were reported missing early Sunday after a trip into Airman's Cave, about four miles south of the university's campus. They were found about halfway down the 12,000-foot-long cave, which has few spaces big enough for an adult to stand upright and is explored primarily by experienced spelunkers. The students were located shortly before 5 p.m. (6 p.m. ET), about 30 hours after they entered. Their names were not released Sunday night. A friend called 911 to report them missing at 5 a.m. The group had told friends to call 911 if they were not back by midnight Sunday, according to Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services. Earlier reports that four students were in the cave were incorrect, Cox said. Authorities did not know Sunday evening why the students were in the cave for so long. But Cox said it would have been easy even for experienced cavers to get lost in Airman's, which he compared to the roots of a tree. ""There are so many ways to go,"" he said.

"He would go upstairs, on the premise that he was saying a prayer with his niece, then sexually abuse her. Now in her 30s, Karen wasn't understood when she first told her parents what her uncle, Mark Sewell, was doing. Sewell was also the son of a trusted older member of the local Jehovah's Witnesses congregation, known as an elder. Christian churches, as well as other religions, have faced claims of child abuse. But what is striking about the Jehovah's Witnesses is their explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house. Because of their practice of following the Bible literally, they insist there must be two witnesses to a crime, often not the case in child abuse cases. However, in Karen's case a second witness did come forward: Wendy, a family friend and fellow member of the Barry congregation in south Wales. She had been raped by the same man. When she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men. Later, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell. Afterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done. This bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a ""judicial committee"" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice. Karen, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process. The elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses. Despite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice. He is now serving a 14-year prison sentence. His punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one. Even when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate. Karen's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved. In a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases. Confidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation. Nowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations. The Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme. In a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile. Their statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously. Karen Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies. For both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group. The organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves ""disfellowshipped"" or shunned. Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house. For many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children. Other churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950. That inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate. However, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing. Only this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years. Todros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community. The case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse. The court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been ""ostracised"" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal. For young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family. Sexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations. Many religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard. The survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith. The Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including: Local authorities The police The Crown Prosecution Service The Immigration Service The BBC The armed forces Schools Hospitals Children's homes Churches, mosques and other religious organisations Charities and voluntary organisations Full details of the inquiry Caroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July.",formal

"Thousands of the furry insects, with a wing span of up to 16cm (6in), interrupted a semi-finals match at the Darul Makmur Stadium last week. Over 800 sightings were also reported in neighbouring Singapore last month, sparking intense online debate. The Lyssa Zampa tropical moth, which is also known as the Laos brown butterfly, is native to South East Asia. Biology lecturer N Sivasothi said that while the moth sightings appear to be ""unprecedented"", it is not a new phenomenon. ""The moths are actually present during other times of the year but in very small numbers, so they are usually not noticed by people,"" Mr Sivasothi said, adding that the creatures typically emerge between April and August every year. Ecologist Anuj Jain said moths' use of light for navigation often causes them to head to built-up areas. ""Their tendency to emigrate in search of new uneaten host plants attracts these moths to light in urban city areas,"" he said. Experts said that while people suffering from asthma may be sensitive to hairs on their wings, the nocturnal creatures do not pose any threat. ""The moths are harmless and the public has nothing to be afraid of,"" said Lena Chan, Director of the National Biodiversity Centre at the National Parks Board in Singapore. ""There is no need for people to protect themselves against these moths as they do not cause any allergies or diseases. In fact, they are important pollinators and are beautiful to watch."" Many Malaysians and Singaporeans however, took to the internet to share their moth encounters and to upload photographs of the winged creatures. Although many seemed to welcome the arrival of the furry insects, others remained cautious. ""In China, moths are viewed as symbols of death as they represent the souls of deceased loved ones,"" said Chinese astrologer Cindy Wu.

"JENA, Louisiana (CNN) -- Charges against Bryant Purvis, one of the six black students accused of being involved in beating a white student, were reduced to second degree aggravated battery during his arraignment Wednesday morning. Bryant Purvis says he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball. Purvis, who was facing charges of second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy, entered a not guilty plea to the reduced charges in the LaSalle Parish Courthouse in Jena. Charges have now been reduced against at least five of the students in the racially charged ""Jena 6"" case. Charges against Jesse Ray Beard, who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime, are unavailable because he's a juvenile. Civil rights leaders Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton led more than 15,000 marchers to Jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- in September to protest how authorities handled the cases against Purvis and five other teens accused of the December 2006 beating of fellow student Justin Barker. After the arraignment, Purvis said he has moved to another town to complete high school. He said he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball, which he hopes to play in college. Mychal Bell, 17, is the only one of the ""Jena 6"" teens still in jail. Although he was released in September after his adult criminal conviction for the beating was overturned, he was ordered two weeks later to spend 18 months in a juvenile facility for a probation violation relating to an earlier juvenile conviction. A district judge tossed out Bell's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery, saying the matter should have been handled in juvenile court. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal in Lake Charles, Louisiana, did the same with Bell's battery conviction in mid-September. Prosecutors originally charged all six black students accused of being involved in beating Barker with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs a target to reduce six week delays in discharging patients had been delivered. But Labour said it had not been met for more than three years, and called for her to amend the record. Ms Sturgeon's office said she would not be revising her remarks because the six-week target had been met in the past. Delayed discharge - sometimes referred to as bed blocking - is when a patient is not released from hospital despite being clinically well enough to be discharged, often because of a lack of care of care services. Ms Sturgeon faced criticism over the issue during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, with Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale saying that people had remained in hospital for a total of 612,000 days last year when they were well enough to go home. She said Ms Sturgeon had told the SNP conference in 2011 that patients spent 200,000 days in a hospital bed when they did not need to. Ms Dugdale added: ""That means it has more than trebled under the SNP government since this first minister admitted there was something badly wrong. So, by any measure that is unacceptable. ""That is thousands of patients, the majority of whom are elderly, ready to go back home or into the community but can't because the extra support they need just isn't there."" She also claimed that delayed discharge got worse during the peak of summer despite Health Secretary Shona Robison saying in February that she wanted to ""completely eradicate"" the problem. The substance is this. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target."" A delay of that duration, for the avoidance of doubt, involves a patient being kept in hospital for at least six weeks longer than clinically necessary, generally because no alternative care is available. Dr Simpson said he had checked with parliament's own information centre. Based on that research, allied to his own knowledge, he believed the First Minister's remarks were misleading. According to Labour, Scotland's patients had not enjoyed ""zero delays over six weeks"" for three years. That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge. The immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. The general tenor of her remarks was that matters were improving - while there remained more to be done. Dr Simpson has now, in effect, suggested that Ms Sturgeon might reconsider that stance. Read more from Brian Ms Sturgeon responded by acknowledging that there was still work to do, but said ""real progress"" was being made. She later added: ""Since 2007 there's been a 52% reduction in delays over four weeks, a 55% reduction in delays over six weeks, the number of delays over three days is down by 50%, the number of delays over four weeks has been reduced as well. ""Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we're now focusing on ensuring patients are discharged within 72 hours."" That comment drew an angry response from Labour MSP Dr Richard Simpson, who subsequently made a formal point of order to the presiding officer. Dr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012. He also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone. Dr Simpson added: ""We all know that nationalist rhetoric is divorced from reality but this is completely unacceptable. It was completely wrong to claim that these targets had been met when in reality thousands of patients had waited in hospital beds. ""Our NHS is in real trouble. The health minister pledged to abolish delayed discharge by the end of the year. Instead it is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile we see the first minister is making completely false claims about her government's record. ""Patients and staff don't benefit from bogus claims about NHS performance. The first minister should correct the record, and this SNP government should get a grip of delayed discharge rather than bury their heads in the sand."" But a Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government. ""Subsequently, the Scottish government introduced new tougher targets that no patient should wait more than four weeks, and later two weeks, from when they are clinically ready for discharge. ""Working with our partners in local government we've made the level of performance we expect tougher still, with an ambition for patients to be delayed for no more than 72 hours.""",formal

"What applications? Are you talking SIMT or SIMD? I have considerable experience with coding *real* world applications (in customer's hands) for many-core (single die) architectures at this scale and [much] larger. I also write compilers for them. Could you give us an estimate of your current fetch/ALU ratio? For those who don't know about these devices, let me put it into GPU terms (SIMT only; SIMD is much, much harder to analyze): fetch would correspond to a texture sample, ALU is the work done on the sample. If the arch's fetch/ALU ratio is 1:4, then you need 4 (pure, non loading) arithmetic operations per memory request to keep the part ""fed"". A ratio as low as 1:4 is only really possible with low clock rate/memory rate ratio, and (nearly pure) SIMT. For instance, a large RT pixel shader on a Radeon 5870 would have numbers like this. SIMT means ""single instruction multiple thread"" and refers to totally non-communicating processes. SIMD means ""single instruction multiple data"", where each lane is allowed to communicate. For instance, the SSE instruction HADD is SIMD, not SIMT, because the lanes of the vector unit ""talk"". Likewise, gather is SIMT, whereas permute is SIMD. For many core (single die) devices, another problem is that the workload has to be fairly homogenous across all the ALU [vector] units, or you will starve the units when they thrash the local working set of hot data. This means that for SIMT architectures, it is not just enough to have homogeneous per ALU [vector] work, but also homogeneous workload across the entire device. This is entirely different from, say, the large scale server x86 boxes. These devices are truly high-throughput serial devices, designed to allow an enormous amount of thrash on the local working set. They do this with high frequency rates, OOO pipes, and staged caches of every (ginormous) sizes, and narrow vector units. **tl;dr** This is possible on GPGPU-like (homogeneous) workloads with a low clock rate.

The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of Abeche, where the children were taken, to a judge in N'Djamena, the capital, Hissene said. The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports. The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF said most of the children were living with their families before Zoe's Ark took them. The charity said the children were Sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation. The agencies said most of the children also probably come from Chadian villages along Chad's border with Sudan. The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities. Watch a report on whether the children are orphans » . Chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities. Chad's interior minister said Zoe's Ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help. The charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted. The Spaniards and Belgian are charged with complicity. The Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive said Thursday. ""We thought we were doing a humanitarian transport,"" said Antoni Cajal, sales director of Spain's Gir Jet charter firm. ""If an NGO [nongovernmental organization] has done something wrong, it's impossible for us to know."" Spain's Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to Chad to try to win the group's release. Over the weekend, the captain appealed urgently to be rescued, fearing the crew could be harmed or killed, Cajal said. But the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, Cajal said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them. The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, Cajal said. On its Web site, Zoe's Ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of physicians, nurses, firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf. The Red Cross, UNHCR and UNICEF said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy. The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds. ""So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from Chadian villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border,"" the agencies said. ""Ninety-one children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent,"" the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing. The agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children, their youth and the situation in the region. Other French charities earlier had questioned whether Zoe's Ark could legally arrange adoption of children from Darfur, and contacted French authorities, according to French newspapers and The Associated Press. French authorities have reacted angrily to the Zoe's Ark trip, calling the group's actions ""illegal and irresponsible."" The French Foreign Ministry has said the dispute will not affect France's participation in a European peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between Chad and Sudan. In response to the dispute in Chad, the Republic of Congo said late Wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions, The Associated Press reported. Reporters Without Borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in Chad. The organization said photographers Marc Garmirian of the Capa news agency and Jean-Daniel Guillou of the Synchro X agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity's efforts. The third journalist, Marie-Agnes Peleran of the TV station France 3 Miditerranee, was traveling with the group in a personal capacity, though she carried a camera from her station, Reporters Without Borders said.

"I take a beta blocker for my heart condition that not only makes me have crazy dreams, they can feel more real than reality. 2 dreams come to mind which were fucked up. The last and most recent was basically unzipping the skin on my barely 1 year old daughter to save the universe under the direction of an alien. I knew it was fucked up, but I honestly believed what the alien was saying so to save the universe I butchered my daughter. Now that was pretty bad and all, but the first really bad dream I had on the beta blocker has stuck with me just as much. In it I was at my parents house with all of us dressed in bdsm gear. I then became aware that I was in a dream and thought to myself wtf? a lucid dream? this is awesome. At that point my feet wouldn't move and my parents gradually walked up to me before violently raping me. I couldn't do anything to wake up and it felt as real as anything I have ever done while awake and sober. It felt like the dream lasted hours, I woke up in tears and didn't say much for a few days instead opting to get extremely wasted until I got over it. TL;DR: Butchered daughter to save the universe and was violently raped for house by my parents, both of which felt as real as reality when awake and sober.",informal

"Overflow pipes at the Burry Inlet near Llanelli are used to help stop flooding. But the European Court of Justice ruled this broke clean water laws in a special conservation area. The Welsh Government, Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water said they were investing in improvements. Though the UK has not been fined, it will have to pay legal costs in a case that also found a number of other breaches around the handling of waste water in England and Gibraltar. The problems stem from the UK's ageing Victorian sewers, engineering marvels of their time, but now out of date. The pipes were designed to mix both sewage and rainwater but over the years new housing developments and more frequent storms as a result of climate change have put pressure on the system. Welsh Water has 3,000 special overflow pipes which act as relief valves to deal with the extra sewage and rainwater but go straight into rivers and the sea. At the Burry Inlet there are 14 overflow pipes which discharge into an area supposed to be protected by UK and EU laws. It includes salt marshes and is a habitat for tens of thousands of wild birds during the winter. 2,200 hectares of saltmarsh - largest continuous area in Wales 20,000 waterfowl are supported 13,590 oystercatchers 35,000 wildbirds spend winter including curlew, godwit and shelduck The local cockling industry has also been hit but Welsh Water insisted this was not due to their discharges. It is investing in a Â£113m project to reduce the number of spills. RainScape involves reducing the amount of water that reaches the sewers through planting green spaces on streets and roofs to absorb rain and building channels to capture surface water. The UK argued the improvements would mean it could comply with EU clean water laws by 2020. However, the ECJ - which rules on disputes involving EU legislation - found the UK had acted ""too late"" and was failing in its obligations. Judges ruled spills contributed to the deterioration of water quality in the Loughor Estuary. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We will continue to work with Natural Resources Wales and Dwr Cymru on a Â£113m programme to reduce the number of spills, improve water quality and reduce the risk of local flooding by 2020."" Welsh Water added: ""We have met the legal permits for water quality in the Loughor estuary and are aware of ever increasing environmental standards and the need to manage long-term challenges, such as climate change, in a truly sustainable away.""

"Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 of 8 March 2001 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs (Text with EEA relevance) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food(1), and in particular Article 2(3) thereof, After consulting the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF), Whereas: (1) Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 provides that maximum levels must be set for certain contaminants in foodstuffs in order to protect public health. These maximum levels must be adopted in the form of a non-exhaustive Community list which may contain levels for the same contaminant in different foodstuffs. The sampling and analysis methods to be applied may be specified. (2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 194/97 of 31 January 1997, setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1566/1999(3), has been amended substantially several times. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity. (3) It is essential, in order to protect public health, to keep contaminants at levels which are toxicologically acceptable. The presence of contaminants must be reduced more thoroughly wherever possible by means of good manufacturing or agricultural practices, in order to achieve a higher level of health protection, especially for sensitive groups of the population. (4) In view of disparities between the laws of Member States in regard to the maximum levels for contaminants in certain foodstuffs and the consequent risk of distortion of competition, Community measures are necessary in order to ensure market unity while abiding by the principle of proportionality. (5) Member States must adopt appropriate surveillance measures regarding the presence of contaminants in foodstuffs. (6) So far, Community legislation does not set maximum levels for contaminants in food intended for infants and young children covered by Commission Directive 91/321/EEC(4), as last amended by Directive 1999/50/EC(5), and Commission Directive 96/5/EC(6), as last amended by Directive 1999/39/EC(7). After having consulted the SCF, specific maximum levels for those foodstuffs should be established as soon as possible. Until then the levels set in this Regulation should also apply to those foodstuffs in so far as no stricter level has been set by national legislation. (7) Food ingredients used for the production of compound foodstuffs should comply with the maximum levels set in this Regulation prior to addition to the said compound foodstuff in order to avoid dilution. (8) Vegetables are the major source of nitrates for human intake. The SCF in its opinion of 22 September 1995 stated that the total intake of nitrates is normally well below the acceptable daily intake. It recommended, however, continuation of efforts to reduce exposure to nitrates via food and water since nitrates can be converted into nitrites and nitrosamines, and urged that good agricultural practices are adopted to ensure nitrate levels are as low as reasonably achievable. The SCF emphasised that concern about the presence of nitrates should not discourage increase in the consumption of vegetables since vegetables have an essential nutritional function and play an important role in health protection. (9) Specific measures designed to provide better control of the sources of nitrates together with codes of good agricultural practice may help to reduce the nitrate levels in vegetables. However, climatic conditions also influence the levels of nitrates in certain vegetables. Different maximum nitrate levels should therefore be fixed for vegetables depending on the season. The climatic conditions vary widely in different parts of the Community. Therefore, Member States should be allowed, for a transitional period, to authorise the marketing of lettuces and spinach grown and intended for consumption in their territory with nitrate levels higher than those fixed in points 1.1 and 1.3 of Annex I, provided, that the quantities present remain acceptable from the point of view of public health. (10) Lettuce and spinach producers established in the Member States which have given the abovementioned authorisations should progressively modify their farming methods by applying the good agricultural practices recommended at national level, so as to comply with the maximum levels laid down at Community level at the end of the transitional period. It is desirable to achieve common values as soon as possible. (11) The levels set for lettuce and spinach should be reviewed and, if possible, reduced before 1 January 2002. This review will be based on monitoring carried out by the Member States and the application of codes of good agricultural practice in order to fix the maximum levels as low as reasonably achievable. (12) The monitoring of nitrate levels in lettuce and spinach and the application of good agricultural practices shall be carried out using means proportionate to the desired objective, the monitoring results obtained and, particularly, in the light of the risks and of experience gained. The application of codes of good agricultural practice in some Member States will be closely observed. It is therefore appropriate that each year Member States communicate the results of their monitoring and report on the measures taken and the progress with regard to the application of codes of good agricultural practice to reduce nitrate levels and that an exchange of views with the Member States on these reports will take place annually. (13) Lower limits are fixed for open-grown lettuce than for lettuce grown under glass, and in order to allow effective control the limits set for open-grown lettuce should apply also to lettuce grown under glass in the absence of precise labelling. (14) Aflatoxins are mycotoxins produced by certain species of Aspergillus, which develop at high temperatures and humidity levels. Aflatoxins are genotoxic carcinogenic substances and may be present in a large number of foods. For substances of this type there is no threshold below which no harmful effect is observed. No tolerable daily intake can therefore be set. Current scientific and technical knowledge and improvements in production and storage techniques do not prevent the development of these moulds and consequently do not enable the presence of the aflatoxins in food to be eliminated entirely. It is, therefore, advisable to set limits as low as reasonably achievable. (15) Efforts to improve production, harvesting and storage methods in order to reduce the development of moulds should be encouraged. The aflatoxins group includes a number of compounds of varying toxicity and frequency in food. Aflatoxin B1 is by far the most toxic compound. It is advisable, for safety reasons, to limit both the total aflatoxin content of food (compounds B1, B2, G1 and G2) and the aflatoxin B1 content. Aflatoxin M1 is a metabolic product of aflatoxin B1, and is present in milk and milk products from animals which have consumed contaminated feed. Even if aflatoxin M1 is regarded as a less dangerous genotoxic carcinogenic substance than aflatoxin B1, it is necessary to prevent the presence thereof in milk and milk products intended for human consumption and for young children in particular. (16) It is recognised that sorting or other physical treatment methods make it possible to reduce the aflatoxin content of groundnuts, nuts and dried fruit. In order to minimise the effects on trade, it is consequently advisable to admit higher aflatoxin content for those products which are not intended for direct human consumption or as an ingredient in foodstuffs. In these cases, the maximum limits for aflatoxins were fixed by taking into consideration at the same time the known possible effects of the above-mentioned treatments for groundnuts, nuts and dried fruit respectively and the need to comply after treatment with the maximum limits fixed for these products intended for direct human consumption or to be used as an ingredient in foodstuffs. In the case of cereals, it cannot be excluded that sorting methods or other physical treatments can reduce the level of contamination of aflatoxins. In order to be able to check the real effectiveness of these methods and, if necessary, to fix specific maximum limits for the unprocessed cereals, it is foreseen for a limited period to apply the maximum limits as laid down in Annex I only for cereals and processed products thereof intended for direct human consumption or as an ingredient in foodstuffs. In the absence of data justifying the fixing of a specific maximum limit for unprocessed cereals, after a well-defined period of time, the maximum limit laid down for cereals and the processed products thereof intended for direct human consumption or as an ingredient of food, will also apply to unprocessed cereals. (17) To allow effective control of the respect of the various limits fixed for the products in question, it is necessary to know the exact destination by means of suitable labelling. Products with levels of aflatoxin exceeding the maximum limit may not be brought into circulation, either as such, after mixture with other foodstuffs or as an ingredient in other foodstuffs. Under Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 315/93, Member States may maintain their national provisions concerning the maximum limits for aflatoxins in certain foodstuffs for which no Community provisions have been adopted. (18) Lead absorption may constitute a serious risk to public health. Lead may induce reduced cognitive development and intellectual performance in children and increased blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases in adults. Over the past decade the levels in food have decreased significantly owing to the awareness of lead as a health problem and source-related efforts to reduce the emission of lead and improvements in quality assurance of chemical analysis. The SCF concluded in its opinion of 19 June 1992 that the mean level of lead in foodstuffs does not seem to be a cause for alarm, however, longer-term action should follow with the objective of further lowering the mean levels of lead in foodstuffs. Therefore, the maximum levels should be as low as reasonably achievable. (19) Cadmium may accumulate in the human body and may induce kidney dysfunction, skeletal damage and reproductive deficiencies. It cannot be excluded that it acts as a human carcinogen. The SCF, in its opinion of 2 June 1995, recommended greater efforts to reduce dietary exposure to cadmium since foodstuffs are the main source of human intake of cadmium. Therefore, maximum levels should be set as low as reasonably achievable. (20) Methylmercury may induce alterations in the normal development of the brain of infants and at higher levels may induce neurological changes in adults. Mercury contaminates mostly fish and fishery products. To protect public health, maximum levels of mercury in fishery products are laid down by Commission Decision 93/351/EEC(8). For reasons of transparency, the relevant measures laid down by that Decision should be transferred to the present Regulation and updated. The levels should be as low as reasonably achievable, taking into account that for physiological reasons certain species concentrate mercury more easily in their tissues than others. (21) 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) is created during food processing under certain conditions. In particular, it may be produced during the manufacture of the savoury food ingredient ""hydrolysed vegetable protein"" that is produced through the acid hydrolysis method (acid-HVP). By adjusting production processes, a significant decrease of 3-MCPD in the abovementioned product has been achieved over the past years. Recently, several Member States have also reported high levels of 3-MCPD in certain samples of soy sauce. In order to enforce good manufacturing practice and to protect the health of consumers, maximum levels of 3-MCPD should be set. The SCF advised, in its opinion of 16 December 1994, which was confirmed on 12 June 1997, that 3-MCPD should be regarded as a genotoxic carcinogen and that residues of 3-MCPD in food products should be undetectable. Recently performed toxicological studies indicate that the substance acts as a non-genotoxic carcinogen in vivo. (22) The maximum levels set in Annex I for 3-MCPD are based on the SCF opinion. The SCF will reevaluate the toxicity of 3-MCPD in the light of new studies. The adequacy of the maximum levels should be reconsidered as soon as the new SCF opinion is available. Member States are requested to examine other foodstuffs for the occurrence of 3-MCPD in order to consider the need to set maximum levels for additional foodstuffs. (23) Any maximum level adopted at Community level will have to be reviewed regularly to take account of the advance of scientific and technical knowledge and improvements in manufacturing or agricultural practices with the objective of achieving steadily decreasing levels. (24) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 1. The foodstuffs indicated in Annex I must not, when placed on the market, contain higher contaminant levels than those specified in that Annex. 2. The maximum levels specified in Annex I shall apply to the edible part of the foodstuffs mentioned. 3. The sampling and analysis methods applied shall be those specified in Annex I. Article 2 1. In the case of products, other than those mentioned under Article 4(1), which are dried, diluted, processed or composed of more than one ingredient, the maximum level applicable shall be that laid down in Annex I, taking into account respectively: (a) changes of the concentration of the contaminant caused by drying or dilution processes, (b) changes of the concentration of the contaminant caused by processing, (c) the relative proportions of the ingredients in the product and (d) the analytical limit of quantification. The first subparagraph shall apply in so far as no specific maximum levels are fixed for these dried, diluted, processed or compound products. 2. The maximum levels specified in Annex I shall apply also to food intended for infants and young children covered by Directive 91/321/EEC and Directive 96/5/EC in so far as no stricter level has been set by national legislation for the specified food products, taking into account respectively, the changes of the concentration of the contaminant caused by drying, dilution or processing and the relative concentrations of the ingredients in the product. Specific maximum levels of contaminants for those foodstuffs shall be established by 5 April 2004 at the latest. 3. Without prejudice to Articles 3(1) and 4(3), it is prohibited to use products as food ingredients for the production of compound foodstuffs which do not comply with the maximum levels set in Annex I. Article 3 1. Member States may, where justified, authorise for a transitional period the placing on the market of fresh lettuces and fresh spinach, grown and intended for consumption in their territory, with nitrate levels higher than those set as maximum levels in points 1.1 and 1.3 of Annex I provided that codes of good agricultural practice are applied to achieve gradual progress towards the levels laid down in this Regulation. Member States shall inform the other Member States and the Commission each year of steps taken to implement the first subparagraph. 2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission by 30 June of each year, the results of their monitoring and report on the measures taken and the progress made with regard to the application and improvement of codes of good agricultural practice to reduce nitrate levels in lettuce and spinach. This information shall also contain the data on which their codes of good agricultural practice are based. 3. The Member States, who do not apply paragraph 1, shall carry out the monitoring of nitrate levels in lettuce and spinach and apply good agricultural practices using means proportionate to the desired objective, the monitoring results obtained, particularly in the light of the risks and of experience gained. Article 4 1. The maximum limits of aflatoxins applicable to the products, as laid down in points 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.2.1 of Annex I shall also be applicable to processed products thereof in so far as no specific maximum limits are fixed for such processed products. 2. With regard to aflatoxins in products mentioned in point 2.1 of Annex I, it is prohibited: (a) to mix products complying with the maximum levels laid down in Annex I with products exceeding these maximum levels or to mix products to be subjected to a sorting technique or physical treatment with products intended for direct human consumption or as an ingredient in foodstuffs, (b) to use products which do not comply with the maximum levels laid down in points 2.1.1.1, 2.1.2.1 and 2.1.3 of Annex I as an ingredient for the manufacture of other foodstuffs, (c) to detoxify products by chemical treatments. 3. Groundnuts, nuts and dried fruit not complying with the maximum levels of aflatoxins laid down in point 2.1.1.1 of Annex I and cereals not complying with the maximum levels laid down in point 2.1.2.1 can be placed on the market provided that these products: (a) are not intended for direct human consumption or used as an ingredient in foodstuffs, (b) comply with the maximum levels laid down in point 2.1.1.2 of Annex I for groundnuts and point 2.1.1.3 of Annex I for nuts and dried fruit, (c) are subjected to a secondary treatment involving sorting or other physical treatments and that after this treatment the maximum limits laid down in points 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.2.1 of Annex I are not exceeded, and this treatment does not result in other harmful residues, (d) are labelled clearly showing their destination, and bearing the indication ""product must be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment to reduce aflatoxin contamination before human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs"". Article 5 1. On the basis of the results of controls carried out by the Member States to check compliance with the maximum levels of nitrates laid down in section 1 of Annex I, the reports with regard to the application and improvement of codes of good agricultural practice to reduce nitrate levels and the evaluation of the data on which the Member States have based their good agricultural practice, the Commission shall proceed, every five years, and before 1 January 2002 for the first time, to a review of the maximum levels with the overall objective of reducing the said levels. 2.

"This is back when i still listened to skrillex. Songs almost always play during my dreams, and this was no exception. This was also a very vivid dream, pretty rare for me. Started at a huge rave with some really hardcore ravers. Piercings everywhere, facial tattoos, shaved heads, the whole bit. Weird for me, since I rarely go to parties, much less raves. Intro to First of the Year by Skrillex starts playing. Everyone's dancing, partying, and people are popping pills. Loooots of drugs. Mostly pills though. And then, right as the drop starts, huge floodlights on the ceiling turn on, illuminating the entire building. Walls are bare, unpainted, white. Everyone in the building turns and stares at me. And then, simultaneously, they all scream, ""call 911 now!"" (the drop) and collapse at the same time. They were dead before they hit the ground. Blood starts coming out of their eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. End of dream. Go listen to the song, this'll make a bit more sense.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will duel for Super Tuesday votes Thursday night as the Democratic presidential hopefuls face off for the first time together minus former Sen. John Edwards. Thursday's debate is taking place at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, California. The debate -- sponsored by CNN, the Los Angeles Times and Politico -- starts at 8 p.m. ET Thursday on CNN and CNN.com. CNN's Wolf Blitzer is the moderator. The event is the first Democratic debate since Obama's convincing victory Saturday in South Carolina. On Tuesday, Clinton won the Florida primary, a contest her campaign said helped the senator regain momentum even though it awarded no delegates. The forum at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood comes hours after the Obama campaign revealed it had raised $32 million in January from roughly 170,000 new donors. That amount will allow Obama to expand his television ad buys greatly in the 20-plus states holding primaries or caucuses Tuesday. Watch a time-lapse construction of the debate set » . The Clinton campaign would not indicate how much money it had raised in the same time period. Mike Gravel, the other Democratic presidential candidate still in the race, was not invited to participate in the debate because he did not meet certain criteria, including support in national polls. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted January 14-17, Gravel received less than 1 percent. Edwards suspended his presidential run Wednesday in New Orleans, Louisiana, but he didn't endorse any candidate despite what aides described as furious lobbying campaigns by Obama and Clinton. Thursday's debate may be slightly more restrained than last week's brutal showdown. Following her South Carolina loss, Clinton has largely steered clear of opportunities to take aim at Obama. Former President Bill Clinton also has avoided criticizing his wife's rival after dominating headlines with his attacks in the days before the South Carolina vote. The economy is likely to dominate Thursday's debate, as both candidates look to appeal to supporters of Edwards and his brand of economic populism. Clinton and Obama have split victories in their parties' early-voting states: Obama has won in Iowa and South Carolina, and Clinton has won in New Hampshire, Nevada, Michigan and Florida. But the Michigan and Florida contests awarded no delegates, and all major Democratic presidential candidates pledged to avoid campaigning in those states following national party penalties against them for moving up their contests so early. Clinton was the only major candidate to appear on the Michigan ballot. Obama is leading Clinton in the number of pledged delegates -- those awarded based on primary or caucus votes. Clinton has the edge when superdelegates are factored in. (Superdelegates are party leaders and elected officials who are not obligated to support a particular candidate. They can change their decisions at any time leading up to the Democratic National Convention in August.) To date, Obama has won an estimated 63 national convention delegates as a result of primary or caucus votes, while Clinton has earned an estimated 48 delegates. Clinton, however, has the overall lead in delegates -- 232 to 158 -- when superdelegates are included. With solid fundraising numbers and a nod from Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts this week, Obama will be making the claim he holds the front-runner title. But Clinton -- who has led in national surveys for much of the race -- will be making her case as well. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report.",formal
"COMMISSION DECISION of 30 May 2006 amending Decision 2006/346/EC concerning certain protection measures relating to classical swine fever in Germany (notified under document number C(2006) 2058) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/391/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 10(4) thereof, Having regard to Council Directive 2001/89/EC of 23 October 2001 on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever (2) and in particular Article 11(1)(f) thereof, Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (3), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) thereof, Whereas: (1) Following outbreaks of classical swine fever in Germany, protection and surveillance zones were immediately established around outbreak sites in Germany in accordance with Article 9(1) of Directive 2001/89/EC. (2) In addition, Commission Decision 2006/346/EC of 15 May 2006 concerning certain protection measures relating to classical swine fever in Germany and repealing Decision 2006/274/EC (4) was adopted in order to maintain and extend the measures taken by Germany pursuant to Directive 2001/89/EC. (3) The provisions for the use of a health marking on fresh meat are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (5). However, pursuant to Council Directive 2001/89/EC, that health mark may not be used for marking the fresh meat from pigs originating from a holding located in a surveillance zone. (4) Pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive 2002/99/EC, Germany has submitted a request for a derogation concerning the health marking provided for in Directive 2001/89/EC and the use of pigmeat from pigs kept on holdings situated in the surveillance zones established in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and slaughtered, subject to a specific authorisation issued by the competent authority. (5) Based on the epidemiological situation as regards classical swine fever in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the pattern of the earlier spread of the disease, the risk of the spread of that disease should not be affected by applying the health marking, laid down in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004, on fresh meat from pigs from a surveillance zone located in certain areas of North Rhine-Westphalia in accordance with the conditions and testing of the pigs laid down in this Decision. It may also be considered that protection from the risk of the spread of that disease should not be affected by marketing the fresh meat without further processing or treatment under those conditions. (6) Based on the information provided by Germany, it is appropriate to review protective measures relating to classical swine fever in Germany as regards the duration of the measures in the protection and surveillance zones established around an outbreak site pursuant to Directive 2001/89/EC. (7) It is also necessary to reintroduce the prohibition for Member States to send pigs to slaughterhouses in the areas of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany where outbreaks of classical swine fever were notified that was revoked by Decision 2006/346/EC. (8) Decision 2006/346/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. (9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Decision 2006/346/EC is amended as follows: 1.

Without prejudice to the measures provided for in Directive 2001/89/EC and in particular Article 11(1)(f) and Article 11(2) of that Directive, where Germany applies the derogation provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article, the pigmeat shall be obtained from pigs which have been slaughtered within 12 hours of arrival at the slaughterhouse and which originate from: (a) a surveillance zone established in the areas listed in Annex I(A) to this Decision, in accordance with Article 9(1) of Directive 2001/89/EC and around a protection zone where: (i) no outbreak of classical swine fever has been detected during a period of 21 days prior to the movement of the pigs to the slaughterhouse and where at least 21 days have elapsed following the completion of the preliminary cleaning and disinfection of the infected holdings; (ii) clinical examinations for classical swine fever have been carried out in all holdings in those protection and surveillance zones following the detection of classical swine fever, with negative results; (b) a holding: (i) which has been authorised by the competent authority to remove pigs to a designated slaughterhouse; (ii) which has had no contact with an infected holding, following the epidemiological inquiry; (iii) which has been subject to regular inspections by a veterinarian following the establishment of the surveillance zone and that inspection has included all pigs kept on the holding; (iv) where all pigs have been submitted to clinical and laboratory examinations in accordance with paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 5 of Chapter IV(D) of the Annex to Decision 2002/106/EC. 3.

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Congolese refugees fled camps Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area, the U.N. refugee agency said. Refugees move along a road Tuesday in Mugunga, near Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A press release from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it didn't appear rebels had targeted the camps, but it reported some were looted after camp residents, classified as internally displaced persons, fled. Roads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting, the UNHCR reported. Torrential rain made the movement even more difficult. ""The main road toward Sake was crowded with people; we had difficulties getting through,"" UNHCR field safety adviser Pierre Nazroo was quoted as saying in the agency's release. ""Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma."" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said, ""They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway. Now they have nothing but what they can carry."" Redmond added, ""These are people in poor health; they are soaking wet because of the torrential downpours. They need shelter, they need water, they need a lot of assistance so we're going to have to move quickly to get that help to them because a lot of them are already in a weakened state."" While the Congolese government accused troops under rebel general Laurent Nkunda of staging the attack, a Nkunda spokesman denied the allegation, according to a report from the Integrated Regional Information Networks, a U.N.-affiliated news service. The spokesman, Bwambale Kakolele, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who also operate in the area were behind the attack, that report said. A spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo said it was uncertain which group attacked the Congo army outpost near the village of Kishangazi, according to the U.N.-affiliated news service. ""We think it could have been insurgents close to Nkunda who attacked, but we cannot rule out the [Rwandan rebels],"" spokesman Col. Pierre Cherayron was quoted as saying. The UNHCR identified the affected camps as Mugunga I, Mugunga II, Lac Vert and Bulengo, saying about 28,000 had abandoned the first three camps and about 2,000 had left Bulengo. The UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year. In the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said. North Kivu is in eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Congolese President Joseph Kabila has tried to gain a cease-fire with the rebels in the area under Nkunda, but fighting continues as hard-liners among the rebels and in the government have blocked reconciliation efforts, according to the International Crisis Group, an nongovernmental organization looking for solutions to conflicts.

"Think of it like mailing pages of a book to different people who own photocopiers. If you have the full set, A, B and C, and then you give three people one of those pages after you've photocopied them, there are now 2 people out of 4 who have A, B or C. Then, everyone photocopies what they have and redistributes it, Which means that you don't have to send out 3 copies of the same file, only 2, and the others contribute one. Same works with torrenting; the more people there are that have a piece of the file, the easier it is to get hold of, and the less each person has to contribute. As soon as someone has a piece, their connection uploads it to torrent programs that want it, and in return they can get pieces from other people. Essentially, the more people involved, the faster the file spreads, because everyone can start copying and sending off the parts they already have.

"(CNN) -- Police and FBI agents are investigating the discovery of an empty rocket launcher tube on the front lawn of a Jersey City, New Jersey, home, FBI spokesman Sean Quinn said. Niranjan Desai discovered the 20-year-old AT4 anti-tank rocket launcher tube, a one-time-use device, lying on her lawn Friday morning, police said. The launcher has been turned over to U.S. Army officials at the 754th Ordnance Company, an explosive ordnance disposal unit, at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, Army officials said. The launcher ""is no longer operable and not considered to be a hazard to public safety,"" police said, adding there was no indication the launcher had been fired recently. Army officials said they could not determine if the launcher had been fired, but indicated they should know once they find out where it came from. The nearest military base, Fort Dix, is more than 70 miles from Jersey City. The Joint Terrorism Task Force division of the FBI and Jersey City police are investigating the origin of the rocket launcher and the circumstance that led to its appearance on residential property. ""Al Qaeda doesn't leave a rocket launcher on the lawn of middle-aged ladies,"" said Paul Cruickshank of New York University Law School's Center on Law and Security. A neighbor, Joe Quinn, said the object lying on Desai's lawn looked military, was brown, had a handle and strap, and ""both ends were open, like you could shoot something with it."" Quinn also said the device had a picture of a soldier on it and was 3 to 4 feet long. An Army official said the device is basically a shoulder-fired, direct-fire weapon used against ground targets -- a modern-day bazooka -- and it is not wire-guided.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq, President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out. President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the North American Leaders summit in Canada. On Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that ""then, as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end,"" according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House. ""Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left,"" Bush will say. ""Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' "" the president will say. The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts. ""Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently,"" Bush will say. On Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, ""President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history. ""While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall."" The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to ""provide broader context"" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop ""surge"" in Iraq until the report comes out in September. Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government » . It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin. Bush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion. The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq. In addition to his analogy to Vietnam, Bush in Wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia, including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the excerpts. ""In the aftermath of Japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy. Then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom,"" Bush will say. ""Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan ... stands as one of the world's great free societies."" Speaking about the Korean War, Bush will note that at the time ""critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that America's intervention was divisive here at home."" ""While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges, America never broke its word,"" Bush will say. ""Without America's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime.""

"Something similar happened to me: I'm in my final year of a 3 year degree, but it's my 5th year doing it. I rarely attended lectures in 1st year and felt like I'd look stupid if I turned up after missing 5/30 lectures already, so why not miss the next 25 too. Scraped through that year. Failed 2nd year because my approach didn't change but the tests got harder. Took a year off and now I'm in 3rd year, haven't missed a single lecture and on top of things. All you need to do is start attending your classes and check your college emails every morning. Once you start doing that you'll start catching up on the material and you'll generally have a week or two before exams to go over the stuff you missed. Tl;dr ATTEND CLASSES",informal

"Media playback is not supported on this device But the West Midlands team have come a long way since their formation in 1991 and can make history on Saturday by reaching the first round of the FA Cup for the first time. It will not be easy against the relative giants of FC United of Manchester but, whatever happens at the Aspray Arena, it will be another chapter in a remarkable story. Sporting Khalsa are fifth in the Midland League Premier Division, the ninth tier of the English football pyramid. On Tuesday, they won at Brocton. The attendance was 87. On Saturday, in excess of 2,000 supporters are expected for the visit of National League North side FC United, who play three tiers above Khalsa, in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round. The winners will earn £12,500 and enter Monday's first-round draw alongside 2008 winners Portsmouth and Wigan, who lifted the trophy by beating Manchester City at Wembley in 2013. ""Preparations started on Sunday because we had to clear an access route for vans to bring in the marquees we are having to use because our bar is not big enough,"" said Inder Grewa, one of Sporting Khalsa's 12 owners, who also acts as treasurer. ""We have never before had to think about marquees because we normally only have 50 people here. ""There was a load of old metal and chairs that needed shifting. Grass verges had to be dug and stone had to be put down to level it off. ""At our level we can't afford to pay people to clear the site. We rely on volunteers. ""We sent one email out and had around 20 people turn up, including the manager and some of the players."" Prior to this FA Cup run, Sporting Khalsa had never had an attendance in three figures, but there were 750 at the Aspray Arena for the visit of Spalding in the third qualifying round. On Saturday, a combination of local interest and FC United's healthy away following - many of whom are intent on making a trip to nearby Dudley to see the statue of legendary Manchester United and England player Duncan Edwards - could see three times that many turn up. Normal home match plans have had to be altered at a club where stadium and bar manager Bal Gacha is the only full-time member of staff. ""We usually print the programmes ourselves on a colour printer,"" Grewa told BBC Sport. ""But we have not been able to do that this weekend because instead of 20 we have had to get a thousand done. ""We have gone up from two stewards to 30. ""We have brought the marquees in because we simply could not accommodate the numbers we are expecting in the bar. Food will be available, though."" Ah yes, the now famous curry house, located within the 4-4-2 bar adjacent to the ground, open on match and non-matchdays. ""We just thought it would be an add-on,"" said Grewa. ""We feed the players but football comes first. Everything here is working towards improving the football side."" It is safe to assume neither Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger nor Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood were required for landscaping duties before last season's FA Cup final. But that was one of the jobs keeping Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe busy this week after answering the call to help create the access route. Building is nothing new for this Black Country club, sandwiched between Wolverhampton and Walsall, whose story of traversing one side of Noose Lane, where it all began in 1991, to the other, where the Asprey Arena is located, is a compelling one, even if it comes with a sad reminder that some racial stereotypes still run deep. Sporting Khalsa emerged from a group of a dozen Sikh lads who would meet on Willenhall Memorial Park for a kickabout at weekends. Playing standards varied. Passion for the game was in them all. Sporting Khalsa entered the local Walsall and District Sunday League, then moved into Saturday football, pushing the boundaries of what could be achieved. In 2004 they joined the West Midlands Regional League. Three promotions have taken them to the upper echelons of the Midland League. Decisions now, as they always have, are achieved through discussion and consensus, sometimes in the car as they travel to away games. Sporting Khalsa's architects were Asian. Their official website calls them a semi-professional Asian club. But it has always been open to all, regardless of religion, skin colour and gender. They bought a pitch at Bloxwich Town but when Aspray Arena became available after Willenhall Town went into administration in 2009, the opportunity to relocate to a stadium barely 400 yards from the Sunday league pitches where the Sporting Khalsa concept first emerged was too tempting to reject. ""There is a group of 12 who you could say are the core of the club,"" said Grewa. ""We were always aware some of us could not play at a good standard. But we just love the game - and we wanted to see how far we could push ourselves. ""You still get the odd comment. We were at an away match recently and someone said, 'I thought you lot only played cricket', so that stereotype is still there. ""It makes me angry that something like that still happens because it is absolutely not true. ""We just love football. It doesn't matter to us if you are black, green or yellow. We welcome anybody. ""We have kids teams from under-6s upwards and four ladies teams. We are a community club - and the community is everybody."" The club have ambitions of climbing higher up the football pyramid, but there is also a conflict about how progress could permanently alter the identity of the club. ""We want to get to the National League,"" said Grewa. ""Once you go into the Football League, it becomes a business. I don't know whether we want that. ""The founders of the club have never fallen out. That only happens if there is money involved. As it is, everyone is treated equally. ""Up to the National League, we could still do our jobs and handle it."" At 15:00 BST on Saturday, the dreaming must stop. By any logic, Sporting Khalsa do not stand a chance of bridging the gap to FC United, akin to a League Two side taking on a Premier League team. They do have an international, central defender Tes Robinson, who plays for St Kitts and Nevis. They also have a forward, Craig Bannister, who has scored nine times in this season's FA Cup. Saturday's match is Sporting Khalsa's seventh FA Cup tie of the season, more than Arsenal played in lifting the trophy in 2014-15. The players share lifts to away games. Many still play Sunday football in addition to Saturdays. And it was not known for certain until less than 24 hours before they left for their replay against Spalding last week that their goalkeeper and winger would be able to play because of work commitments. ""I am a Manchester United fan,"" said manager Ian Rowe, who was appointed at the start of the 2014-15 season. ""I have followed the FC United story from the start. Next to having my kids, this will be one of the proudest moments of my life. ""But let's not kid ourselves. The chance of us reaching the level we will need to win this game is probably one in a hundred. ""AFC Fylde are in the same league as FC United. They beat a team in our league 9-0.

"COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 883/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the keeping of accounts by the paying agencies, declarations of expenditure and revenue and the conditions for reimbursing expenditure under the EAGF and the EAFRD THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), and in particular Article 42 thereof, Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 created a European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and a European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) operating in the context of the shared management of expenditure and assigned revenue under the Community budget. It lays down general requirements and rules on the keeping of accounts and declarations of expenditure and revenue by the paying agencies, and the reimbursement of expenditure by the Commission. These rules and requirements should be clarified, distinguishing between the detailed rules of application common to the two Funds and those specific to each of them. (2) With a view to ensuring the proper management of the appropriations entered in the budget of the European Communities for the two Funds, it is essential that each paying agency should keep separate accounts relating exclusively to expenditure to be financed by the EAGF and by the EAFRD respectively. To this end, the accounts kept by the paying agencies should clearly show, for each of the two Funds, the expenditure effected and revenue assigned under Article 3(1), Article 4 and Article 34 respectively of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, and allow this expenditure and revenue to be linked to the funds made available to them under the Community budget. (3) The common agricultural policy is financed in euro, while allowing Member States which do not form part of the euro zone to make payments to beneficiaries in their national currency. To enable all the expenditure and revenue to be consolidated, it is therefore necessary to lay down that the paying agencies concerned must be able to provide data relating to the expenditure and revenue in both euro and the currency in which the expenditure was incurred and the revenue received. (4) To ensure sound management of financial flows, in particular because the Member States themselves mobilise the funds to cover the expenditure referred to in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 or receive an advance for that referred to in Article 4 of that Regulation before the Commission finances this expenditure in the form of monthly reimbursements of the expenditure effected, the Member States should collect the information necessary for these reimbursements and keep it at the disposal of the Commission as and when expenditure and revenue are effected or transmit it to the Commission at regular intervals. Management methods specific to the EAGF and to the EAFRD must be taken into account in this respect and the provision and transmission of information to the Commission by the Member States should be organised at intervals adapted to the management method of each Fund, without prejudice to the obligation of the Member States to keep the information drawn up for the purposes of proper monitoring of expenditure at the disposal of the Commission. (5) The general obligations as regards the keeping of accounts by the paying agencies cover detailed data required for the management and control of Community funds, the details of which are not required for the reimbursement of expenditure. The information and details relating to expenditure to be financed by the EAGF or the EAFRD which must be sent to the Commission at regular intervals should therefore be specified. (6) Notifications of information by the Member States to the Commission must enable it to use the information sent directly and as effectively as possible for the management of EAGF and EAFRD accounts and the relevant payments. To achieve this objective, all information to be made available or to be communicated between the Member States and the Commission should be sent electronically or in digital form. However, as transmission by other means may be considered necessary, the cases in which this obligation is justified should be laid down. (7) Under Article 8(1)(c)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, for measures relating to operations financed by the EAGF and the EAFRD, declarations of expenditure, which also act as payment requests, must also be sent to the Commission accompanied by the requisite information. To allow the Member States and the paying agencies to draw up these declarations of expenditure in accordance with harmonised rules, and to allow the Commission to take payment requests into consideration, the conditions under which this expenditure may be taken into account under the respective EAGF and EAFRD budgets and the rules that apply to entering expenditure and revenue in the accounts, in particular the assigned revenue and any corrections to be made, and to their actual declaration, should be laid down. (8) Under Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 of 2 August 1978 laying down general rules for the financing of interventions by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section (2), the amount to be financed by an intervention measure is to be determined on the basis of the annual accounts drawn up by the paying agencies. That Regulation also lays down the rules and conditions governing these accounts. Following the abolition of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) by Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, and its replacement by the EAGF as regards the financing of these measures, the terms under which the financing of such measures by the EAGF fits into the system of declarations of expenditure and monthly payments should be made clear. (9) Under Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, expenditure in October counts as being made in the month of October if effected between 1 and 15 October and in the month of November if effected from 16 to 31 October. However, as regards expenditure relating to public storage, all expenditure entered in the accounts in the month of October is taken into account in respect of financial year N + 1. Expenditure financed by the EAGF and resulting from public storage operations carried out in September should therefore be entered in the accounts not later than 15 October. (10) The exchange rates applicable must be laid down according to whether or not an operative event has been defined in the agricultural legislation. To avoid the application, by the Member States which do not form part of the euro zone, of different exchange rates in accounts of revenue received or aid paid to beneficiaries in a currency other than the euro, on the one hand, and in the declaration of expenditure drawn up by the paying agency, on the other, the Member States concerned should apply the same exchange rate in their declarations of expenditure under the EAGF as that used when collecting that revenue or making those payments to beneficiaries. Moreover, to simplify the administrative formalities as regards recoveries for more than one operation, a single exchange rate should apply when entering these recoveries into the accounts. This measure should, however, be limited to operations which took place before the date of application of this Regulation. (11) The Commission is to make payments at monthly or other regular intervals to the Member States on the basis of declarations of expenditure sent by the latter. It must, however, take into account the revenue received by the paying agencies on behalf of the Community budget. The conditions under which certain types of expenditure and revenue effected under the EAGF and the EAFRD are to be offset should therefore be laid down. (12) After approving the monthly payments, the Commission is to place at the disposal of the Member States the funds needed to cover expenditure to be financed by the EAGF and the EAFRD, in accordance with practical arrangements and conditions to be laid down on the basis of information communicated to the Commission by the Member States and the computer systems set up by the Commission. (13) If the Community budget has not been adopted by the beginning of the financial year, under the second subparagraph of Article 13(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (3), payments may be made monthly per chapter to a maximum of one twelfth of the allotted appropriations in the chapter in question of the preceding financial year. To allocate the available appropriations fairly among the Member States, provision should be made for the monthly payments under the EAGF and the regular payments under the EAFRD to be made in this case as a percentage, laid down for each chapter, of the declarations of expenditure submitted by each Member State and for the balance not used in a given month to be reallocated in Commission decisions on subsequent monthly or regular payments. (14) Where, on the basis of the declarations of expenditure received from the Member States under the EAGF, the total amount of advance commitments which could be authorised under Article 150(3) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 is more than half of all corresponding appropriations for the current financial year, the Commission is required to reduce those amounts. For the sake of sound management, that reduction must be shared among all the Member States proportionally, on the basis of the declarations of expenditure received from them. To allocate the available appropriations fairly among the Member States, provision should be made for monthly payments under the EAGF to be made in this case as a percentage, laid down for each chapter, of the declarations of expenditure submitted by each Member State and for the balance not used in a given month to be reallocated in Commission decisions on subsequent monthly payments. (15) Community agricultural legislation includes, for the EAGF, deadlines for payment of aids to beneficiaries which must be complied with by Member States. All payments effected after those deadlines, and for which the delay in payment is unjustified, must be regarded as irregular expenditure, and therefore cannot be the subject of reimbursement by the Commission. However, in order to modulate the financial impact in proportion to the delay incurred in payment, provision should be made for the Commission to graduate the reduction in the payments according to the length of delay recorded. A fixed margin must be laid down, moreover, so that reductions are not applied where the delays in payment result from legal disputes. (16) As part of the reform of the common agricultural policy and the introduction of the single payment scheme, Member State compliance with the payment deadlines is vital to the proper application of the rules on financial discipline. Specific rules should therefore be laid down to help avoid, wherever possible, any risk of the annual appropriations available in the Community budget being exceeded. (17) Under Articles 17 and 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 the Commission may reduce or temporarily suspend payments to the Member States if they do not meet the deadlines laid down for the payments or do not notify data relating to expenditure or information provided for in that Regulation to verify the consistency of such data. The same applies, as regards the EAFRD, if the Member States do not notify the information required under Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (4) and its implementing rules, including the mid-term evaluation report for the programmes. In this context, the implementing rules for these reductions and suspensions should be laid down for EAGF and EAFRD expenditure respectively. (18) Article 180 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 provides that negative agricultural expenditure is to be replaced from 1 January 2007 by revenue assigned, according to origin, to either appropriations for the EAGF or the EAFRD. Under Article 32(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 the sums recovered by the paying agencies following the occurrence of irregularity or negligence are to be booked by them as assigned revenue. Some sums established following irregularities or reductions applied in the case of failure to comply with the environmental rules are comparable to the revenue relating to irregularities or negligence referred to in Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and should therefore be treated in a similar way to such revenue. Provision should therefore be made for the corresponding amounts to be entered in the accounts under the same terms as the assigned revenue coming directly from the irregularities or negligence referred to in that Article 32. (19) The expenditure co-financed by the Community budget and the national budgets as support for rural development under the EAFRD is based on programmes broken down by measure. It must therefore be monitored and entered into the accounts on this basis so that all operations can be identified by programme and by measure and so that it can be verified that there is an adequate match between the expenditure effected and the financial resources provided. In this context the elements to be taken into account by the paying agencies should be specified and it should be laid down, in particular, that the origin of public and Community funds must be clearly shown in the accounts in relation to the financing effected, and that the amounts to be recovered from beneficiaries and the amounts which have been recovered are identified and shown in relation to the original operations. (20) Where a payment or recovery operation is carried out in a national currency other than the euro, under rural development programmes financed by the EAFRD, the corresponding amounts must be converted into euro. Provision should therefore be made for a single exchange rate to be applied to all operations entered into the accounts in the course of a given month, to be used for the declarations of expenditure. (21) Forecasts of the amounts still to be funded by the EAFRD for a calendar year and estimates of funding requests for the following calendar year are required by the Commission for the purposes of its budgetary and financial management. The information in question must be sent to the Commission in sufficient time to enable it to meet its obligations, and in any event twice a year, not later than 31 January and 31 July each year. (22) To allow the Commission to validate the financing plan for each rural development programme, to provide for any changes to it and to carry out the necessary checks, certain information should be brought to its attention. To this end, each managing authority for the programmes must enter the required information into the EAFRD common computer system, to allow the Commission to determine, in particular, the maximum amount of the EAFRD contribution, its annual breakdown, a breakdown by priority and measure and the co-financing rates applicable for each priority. The terms on which the total amounts are to be registered in the common computer system should also be laid down. (23) The deadlines for drawing up the declarations of expenditure on operations under the EAFRD must be set by the Commission in accordance with Article 26(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. In view of the specific characteristics of the accounting rules which apply to the EAFRD, the use of prefinancing and the financing of the measures by calendar year, provision should be made for this expenditure to be declared at intervals adapted to these specific conditions. (24) Exchanges of information and documents between the Commission and the Member States, and the provision and notification of information from the Member States to the Commission are generally carried out electronically or in digital form. In order to improve the way such exchanges of information under the EAGF and the EAFRD are dealt with and to extend their use, it is necessary to adapt the existing computer systems or set up new ones. Provision should be made for this to be done by the Commission and implemented after informing the Member States via the Committee on the Agricultural Funds. (25) The conditions under which information is processed by these computer systems and the form and content of documents which have to be communicated under Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 have to be adjusted frequently in line with changes to the applicable rules or management requirements. Uniform presentation of the documents to be sent in by the Member States is also necessary. To achieve these objectives and to simplify procedures and ensure that the computer systems concerned can be made operational immediately, the form and content of the documents should be laid down on the basis of models, which should be adapted and updated by the Commission after informing the Committee on the Agricultural Funds. (26) The paying agencies are responsible for the management and control of the legality of EAGF and EAFRD expenditure. The data on financial transactions must therefore be communicated or entered in the computer systems and updated under the responsibility of the paying agency, by the paying agency itself or the body to which that function has been delegated, where applicable via the accredited coordinating body. (27) Certain documents or procedures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and its implementing rules require the signature of an authorised person or the approval of a person at one or more of the stages of the procedure in question. In such cases, the computer systems set up for the communication of these documents must make it possible to identify each person unambiguously and provide reasonable assurance that the contents of the documents, including as regards the stages of the procedure, cannot be altered. This must apply, in particular, as regards the declarations of expenditure and the statement of assurance attached to the annual accounts referred to in Article 8(1)(c)(i) and (iii) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and the documents communicated by electronic means under these procedures. (28) The rules applicable to the communication of electronic and digitised documents have been laid down at Community level, as regards the means of their transmission, the conditions under which they are valid for the Commission’s purposes and the conditions for keeping such documents and for their integrity and legibility. Insofar as the shared management of the Community budget under the EAGF and the EAFRD concerns documents drawn up or received by the Commission or the paying agencies and the procedures put in place for the financing of the common agricultural policy, provision should be made for the application of Community legislation to the communication of electronic and digitised documents carried out under this Regulation and the periods for which electronic and digitised documents are to be kept should be laid down. (29) The communication of information by electronic means may prove impossible in certain situations. To resolve possible malfunctions in a computer system or deal with the absence of a stable connection, the Member State must be able to send the documents in another form, under conditions which should be laid down. (30) Under Article 39(1)(d) and (e) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the financial resources available in a Member State on 1 January 2007 following reductions in or cancellations of the amounts of payments which that Member State has made voluntarily, in accordance with Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1655/2004 of 22 September 2004 laying down rules for the transition from the optional modulation system established by Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 to the mandatory modulation system established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (5) or by way of a penalty, under Articles 3, 4 and 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy (6), must be used by that Member State to finance rural development measures. If Member States do not use the financial resources within a certain period, the corresponding amounts are to be repaid to the EAGF budget. In order to lay down the terms of application of these measures, rules must be laid down for the accounting and management of the amounts concerned by the paying agencies, and for taking them into account in Commission payment decisions. (31) Under Article 39(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the Member States belonging to the European Union before 1 May 2004 may, in justified cases and under certain conditions laid down in that point, be authorised by the Commission to continue payments for rural development programmes for the period 2000 to 2006 until 31 December 2006. To allow the application of this derogation, the procedure to be followed, the deadlines to be met by the Member States and the terms for implementing it should be laid down. (32) Commission Regulation (EC) No 296/96 of 16 February 1996 on data to be forwarded by the Member States and the monthly booking of expenditure financed under the Guarantee Section of the Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2776/88 (7) and Commission Decision C/2004/1723 of 26 April 2004 on the form of documents to be transmitted by the Member States for entry in the accounts of expenditure financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section (8) should therefore be repealed. (33) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Agricultural Funds, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER 1 COMMON INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS FOR THE EAGF AND EAFRD Article 1 Subject matter This Regulation lays down certain specific requirements and rules on the shared management of expenditure and revenue under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the keeping of accounts and declarations of expenditure and revenue by the paying agencies, and the reimbursement of expenditure by the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.

Each paying agency shall keep a set of accounts covering only the expenditure and revenue referred to in Article 3(1), Article 4 and Article 34 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and the use of the funds made available to it to defray the corresponding expenditure. These accounts shall enable the financial data for the EAGF and the EAFRD to be distinguished and provided separately. 2. The paying agencies of the Member States which do not form part of the euro zone shall keep accounts covering the amounts expressed in the currency in which the expenditure was incurred and the revenue received. However, to enable all their expenditure and revenue to be consolidated, they must be able to provide the corresponding data in national currency and in euro. However, for EAGF expenditure and revenue other than that referred to in Article 45(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, Member States unable to introduce an accounting system meeting these requirements by 16 October 2006 may, after having informed the Commission thereof by 15 September 2006 at the latest, postpone that deadline to 16 October 2007. CHAPTER 2 EAGF ACCOUNTS Article 3 Provision of information by Member States Member States shall collect and keep available for the Commission information on total expenditure effected and assigned revenue received each week as follows: (a) by the third working day of each week at the latest, information on total expenditure effected and assigned revenue received from the beginning of the month until the end of the preceding week; (b) by the third working day of the month at the latest, where the week runs over two months, information on total expenditure effected and assigned revenue received during the preceding month. Article 4 Communication of information by Member States 1. In accordance with Article 8(1)(c)(i) and (ii) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, Member States shall send the Commission, electronically, the following information and documents, under the terms laid down in Articles 5 and 6 of this Regulation: (a) by the third working day of each month at the latest, information on total expenditure effected and assigned revenue received during the preceding month, on the basis of the model in Annex I, and any information explaining any substantial difference between the estimates drawn up in accordance with paragraph 2(a)(iii) of this Article and expenditure effected and assigned revenue received; (b) by the tenth day of each month at the latest, the declaration of expenditure referred to in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 covering the total amount of expenditure effected and assigned revenue received during the preceding month, and the total amount of expenditure effected and assigned revenue received relating to public storage, on the basis of the model in Annex II to this Regulation. However, the communication on expenditure effected and assigned revenue received between 1 and 15 October shall be sent by the 25th day of the same month. The declaration of expenditure shall include a breakdown of expenditure effected and assigned revenue by article of the nomenclature of the budget of the European Communities and, for the chapters relating to the audit of agricultural expenditure and to the assigned revenue, a further breakdown by item. However, where budgetary monitoring is subject to exceptional conditions, the Commission may request a more detailed breakdown; (c) by the 20th day of each month at the latest, a set of documents permitting the booking to the Community budget of expenditure effected and assigned revenue received by the paying agency during the preceding month, with the exception of the set of documents permitting the booking of expenditure effected and assigned revenue received between 1 and 15 October, which shall be submitted by 10 November; (d) by 20 May and 10 November of each year at the latest, in addition to the set of documents referred to in point (c), the amounts withheld and used in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 and Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1655/2004. 2. The set of documents referred to in paragraph 1(c) shall consist of: (a) a statement (T104, in Annex V), drawn up by each paying agency, broken down according to the nomenclature of the budget of the European Communities and by type of expenditure and revenue, on the basis of a detailed nomenclature made available to the Member States covering: (i) the expenditure effected and assigned revenue received during the preceding month, (ii) total expenditure effected and assigned revenue received from the beginning of the financial year until the end of the preceding month, (iii) estimates of expenditure and assigned revenue, covering, as appropriate: - the current month and the following two months only, - the current month, the following two months and to the end of the financial year; (b) a summary (T103, in Annex IV) of the data referred to in point (a), by Member State, for all that Member State’s paying agencies; (c) a statement of any difference (T101, in Annex III) between the expenditure declared in accordance with paragraph 1 (b) and expenditure declared in accordance with point (a) of this paragraph together, where appropriate, with the reasons for such difference; (d) the accounts evidencing expenditure and revenue relating to public storage, as referred to in Article 10(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 (9), presented in the form of tables (e. FAUDIT tables) in accordance with Annex III to that Regulation; (e) tables (T106 to T109, in Annexes VI, VII, VIII and IX) supplementing those referred to in points (a) and (b) for the communications of 20 May and 10 November, as referred to in paragraph 1(d), showing the state of the accounts at the end of April and the end of the financial year, comprising: - a communication of the amounts withheld by each paying agency under Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 or Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1655/2004, including any interest (T106 and T107), - details of the use made by each paying agency of the corresponding amounts in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 or Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1655/2004 (T108), - an overall summary for each Member State of the data referred to in the first and second indents of this point and the interest generated by unused funds (T109). 3. The summary of data (T103) provided for in paragraph 2(b) shall also be sent to the Commission on paper. 4. All the financial information required under this Article shall be communicated in euro. However: - for the tables referred to in paragraph 2(e), Member States shall use the same currency as that used in the financial year in which the amounts were withheld, - for the declarations of expenditure and of deductions referred to in Article 39(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, Member States shall use their national currency. Moreover, for the financial information on the 2007 financial year, other than that referred to in Article 45(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the Member States referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 2(2) of this Regulation shall make their communications in national currency. Article 5 General rules on the declaration of expenditure and on assigned revenue 1. Without prejudice to the special provisions on declarations of expenditure and revenue relating to public storage referred to in Article 6, expenditure and assigned revenue declared by the paying agencies in respect of a given month shall correspond to payments and receipts actually effected during that month. That expenditure and revenue shall be entered in the accounts of the EAGF budget in respect of financial year ‘N’ beginning on 16 October of year ‘N-1’ and ending on 15 October of year ‘N’. However: (a) expenditure which may be paid prior to the implementation of the provision permitting it to be wholly or partially borne by the EAGF may be declared only: - in respect of the month during which the provision in question was implemented; or - in respect of the month following implementation of that provision; (b) assigned revenue which the Member State owes the Commission shall be declared in respect of the month during which the time limit for payment of the corresponding amounts, laid down in Community legislation, expires; (c) corrections decided by the Commission under the clearance of accounts and the conformity clearance shall be deducted from or added to the monthly payments referred to, as appropriate, in Article 10(2) or Article 11(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 (10) directly by the Commission. However, the Member States shall include the amounts corresponding to these corrections in the declaration drawn up for the month for which the corrections are made. 2. Expenditure and assigned revenue shall be taken into consideration on the date on which the account of the paying agency was debited or credited. However, for payments, the date to be taken into consideration may be the date on which the agency concerned issued the payment document and sent it to a financial institution or to the beneficiary. Each paying agency shall use the same method throughout the financial year. 3. The expenditure to be declared shall not take into account the reductions applied under Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1655/2004. 4. Expenditure and assigned revenue declared in accordance with paragraph 1 may incorporate corrections to the amounts declared for previous months in the same financial year. Where corrections to assigned revenue lead, at paying agency level, to the declaration of negative revenue assigned for a budget line, surplus corrections shall be carried over to the following month. They shall, where appropriate, be settled when the accounts for the year concerned are cleared. 5. Payment orders which are not executed and payments debited to the account, then re-credited, shall be shown in the accounts as deductions from expenditure in respect of the month during which the failure to execute or the cancellation is reported to the paying agency. 6. Where payments due under the EAGF are encumbered by claims, they shall be deemed to have been effected in their entirety for the purpose of applying paragraph 1: (a) on the date of the payment of the sum due to the beneficiary, if the claim is less than the expenditure settled; (b) on the date of set-off, if the expenditure is less than or equal to the claim. 7. Cumulative data relating to expenditure and assigned revenue that can be charged to a specific financial year, to be submitted to the Commission by 10 November at the latest, may be corrected only in the annual accounts to be sent to the Commission in accordance with Article 8(1)(c)(iii) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. Article 6 Special rules on declarations of expenditure relating to public storage The operations to be taken into consideration for drawing up declarations of expenditure relating to public storage shall be those entered at the end of a given month in the accounts of the paying agency which have taken place from the beginning of the accounting year within the meaning of Article 2(3)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 up to the end of that month. Such declarations of expenditure shall comprise the values and amounts determined in accordance with Articles 6, 7 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 entered in the accounts by the paying agencies during the month following that to which the operations relate. However: (a) in the case of operations carried out in the course of September, the values and amounts shall be entered in the accounts by the paying agencies by 15 October at the latest, (b) in the case of the overall depreciation amounts referred to in Article 4(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 884/2006, the amounts shall be entered in the accounts on the date laid down in the decision providing for them. Article 7 Applicable exchange rate for drawing up declarations of expenditure 1. For drawing up their declarations of expenditure, Member States which do not form part of the euro zone shall apply the same exchange rate as that which they used to make payments to beneficiaries or receive revenue, in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 (11) and the sectoral agricultural legislation. 2. In cases other than those referred to in paragraph 1, in particular for operations for which an operative event has not been laid down by the sectoral agricultural legislation, the applicable exchange rate shall be the last-but-one exchange rate established by the European Central Bank before the month in respect of which the expenditure or assigned revenue is declared. 3. The exchange rate referred to in paragraph 2 shall also apply to recoveries made collectively for a number of operations carried out before 16 October 2006, or 16 October 2007 where the second subparagraph of Article 2(2) applies. Article 8 Payment decision by the Commission 1. On the basis of the data sent in accordance with Article 4(1)(b), the Commission shall adopt decisions and make the monthly payments, without prejudice to corrections to be taken into account in subsequent decisions and application of Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. 2. If the Community budget has not been adopted by the beginning of the financial year, the monthly payments shall be granted as a percentage of the declarations of expenditure received from each Member State, laid down for each chapter of expenditure and within the limits laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002. The Commission shall take the balance of amounts not reimbursed to the Member States into account in decisions on subsequent reimbursements. 3. If the advance commitments referred to in Article 150(3) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 exceed one half of the total corresponding appropriations for the current financial year, the monthly payments shall be granted as a percentage of the declarations of expenditure received from each Member State. The Commission shall take the balance of amounts not reimbursed to the Member States into account in decisions on subsequent reimbursements. Article 9 Reduction in payments by the Commission 1. Monthly payments shall be reduced for any expenditure effected after the deadlines laid down, as follows: (a) where expenditure effected after the deadlines is equal to 4 % or less of the expenditure effected before the deadlines, no reduction shall be made; (b) above the threshold of 4 %, all further expenditure effected late shall be reduced in accordance with the following rules: - for a delay of up to one month, expenditure shall be reduced by 10 %, - for a delay of up to two months, expenditure shall be reduced by 25 %, - for a delay of up to three months, expenditure shall be reduced by 45 %, - for a delay of up to four months, expenditure shall be reduced by 70 %, - for a delay of more than four months, expenditure shall be reduced by 100 %. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, in the case of the direct payments referred to in Article 12 and Title III or, where applicable, in Title IVa of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (12) made in respect of year N, paid out after the deadlines laid down and after 15 October of year N+1, the following conditions shall apply: (a) where the 4 % threshold referred to in paragraph 1(a) has not been used in full for payments made no later than 15 October of year N+1 and the remainder of the threshold exceeds 2 %, that remainder shall be reduced to 2 %; (b) in any case, payments made in the course of financial year N+2 and subsequent years shall be eligible for the Member State concerned only up to the level of its national ceiling as provided for in Annexes VIII or VIIIa to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 or its annual financial envelope established in accordance with Article 143b(3) of that Regulation for the year preceding that of the financial year during which the payment is made, where applicable plus the amounts relating to the dairy premium and additional payments provided for in Articles 95 and 96 of that Regulation and the additional amount of aid provided for in Article 12 of that Regulation, less the percentage provided for in Article 10 of that Regulation and corrected by the adjustment provided for in Article 11 thereof, taking account of Article 12a of that Regulation and the amounts set in Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 188/2005 (13); (c) above the thresholds referred to in point (a), the expenditure concerned by this paragraph shall be reduced by 100 %. 3. The Commission shall apply a different time scale from those laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2, and/or lower reductions or none at all, if exceptional management conditions are encountered for certain measures or if justified reasons are advanced by the Member States. However, in the case of the payments referred to in paragraph 2, the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall apply within the ceilings referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2. 4. Checks on compliance with the deadlines, for the purposes of the monthly payments against booking of expenditure, shall be made twice each financial year: - on expenditure effected by 31 March, - on expenditure effected by 31 July. Any overrun of deadlines in August, September and October shall be taken into account in the accounts clearance decision referred to in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. 5. The Commission, having informed the Member States concerned, may defer the monthly payments to the Member States as provided for in Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 where the communications referred to in Article 4 of this Regulation arrive late or contain discrepancies which necessitate further checks. 6. The reductions referred to in this Article and any other reductions applied under Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 shall be applied without prejudice to the subsequent decision on conformity clearance, as referred to in Article 31 of that Regulation. Article 10 Keeping of accounts on and collecting assigned revenue 1. Articles 150 and 151 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the keeping of accounts of assigned revenue referred to in this Regulation. 2. In its decision on the monthly payments taken under Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the Commission shall pay the balance of the expenditure declared by each Member State, less the assigned revenue which that Member State has included in the same declaration of expenditure. This set-off shall be regarded as equivalent to collection of the corresponding revenue. 3. Commitment appropriations and payment appropriations generated by assigned revenue shall be open once this revenue has been assigned to budget lines. Assignment shall take place when the assigned revenue is entered into the accounts, within two months after receipt of the statements sent by the Member States, in accordance with the rules referred to in paragraph 1. Article 11 Making funds available to the Member States 1. After approval of the monthly payments, the Commission shall place at the disposal of the Member States, within the framework of the budget appropriations, the funds needed to cover expenditure to be financed by the EAGF, less the corresponding amount of assigned revenue, in the account opened by each Member State. When the payments to be made by the Commission, minus the assigned revenue, lead to a negative amount for a Member State, the surplus deductions shall be carried over to the following months. 2. Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the name and number of the account referred to in paragraph 1 in accordance with the format made available to it by the Commission. 3. Where a Member State as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 2(2) continues to make its declarations in national currency for the 2007 financial year, the exchange rate to be applied by the Commission for the corresponding payments shall be that applicable on the 10th of the month following the month for which the declaration is drawn up or, if no rate is quoted for that date, that of the first day preceding that date for which a rate is quoted. Article 12 Amounts deemed to be assigned revenue 1. The following sums shall be deemed to be assigned revenue in the same way as sums recovered following the occurrence of an irregularity or negligence as referred to in Article 32(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005: (a) sums payable to the Community budget, which have been collected as a consequence of penalties or sanctions in accordance with specific rules laid down in sectoral agricultural legislation; (b) amounts corresponding to reductions or exclusions of payments applied in accordance with the rules on cross-compliance laid down in Chapter 1 of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 2. The rules laid down for assigned revenue other than that referred to in paragraph 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis. However, if the sums referred to in paragraph 1(a) have been withheld before the payment of the aid concerned by the irregularity or negligence, they shall be deducted from the corresponding expenditure. CHAPTER 3 EAFRD ACCOUNTS Article 13 Rural development programme accounts 1. Each paying agency designated for a rural development programme shall keep accounts enabling all the operations for each programme and each measure to be identified. Such accounts shall include in particular: (a) the amount of public expenditure and the amount of the Community contribution paid for each operation; (b) the amounts to be recovered from beneficiaries for irregularities or negligence found, (c) the amounts recovered, with an indication of the original operation. 2. To draw up their declarations of expenditure in euro, the paying agencies of the Member States which do not form part of the euro zone shall apply, for each payment or recovery operation, the last-but-one exchange rate established by the European Central Bank prior to the month in which the operations are registered in the accounts of the paying agency. Article 14 Forecast of funding requirements For each rural development programme, the Member States shall send the Commission, in accordance with Article 8(1)(c)(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, using the model in Annex X to this Regulation, twice per year, together with the declarations of expenditure to be sent by 31 January and 31 July at the latest, their forecasts of the amounts to be funded by the EAFRD for the current year, and an updated estimate of their funding requests for the following year. Article 15 Financing plan for rural development programmes The financing plan for each rural development programme shall lay down, in particular, the maximum amount of the EAFRD contribution, its annual breakdown, a breakdown by priority and measure and the co-financing rates applicable for each priority. The financing plan shall enter into force after the rural development programme has been adopted by the Commission. Subsequent adjustments to the financing plan which do not require the adoption of a new decision by the Commission shall enter into force after validation of those adjustments, by means of the secure system for the exchange of information and documents between the Commission and the Member States introduced for the purposes of applying Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005. Adjustments to the financing plan which require the adoption of a new decision by the Commission shall enter into force after adoption of the new decision. The financing plan for each rural development programme and any adjustments thereof shall be entered by the managing authority for that programme in the secure system for the exchange of information referred to in the second subparagraph. Article 16 Declarations of expenditure 1. The paying agencies shall make declarations of expenditure for each rural development programme. These declarations shall cover, for each rural development measure, the amount of eligible public expenditure for which the paying agency has actually paid the corresponding EAFRD contribution during the reference period. 2. Once the programme has been approved, Member States shall send the Commission, in accordance with Article 8(1)(c)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, their declarations of expenditure electronically in accordance with Article 18 of this Regulation by the following deadlines: (a) by 30 April at the latest in the case of expenditure in the period 1 January to 31 March; (b) by 31 July at the latest in the case of expenditure in the period 1 April to 30 June; (c) by 10 November at the latest in the case of expenditure in the period 1 July to 15 October; (d) by 31 January at the latest in the case of expenditure in the period 16 October to 31 December. Expenditure declared in respect of a period may contain corrections to data declared in respect of the preceding declaration periods of the same financial year. However, if a rural development programme has not been approved by the Commission by 31 March 2007, all the expenditure carried out in anticipation by the paying agency under its own responsibility, during the periods preceding the adoption of this programme, shall be declared to the Commission in the first declaration of expenditure following the adoption of the programme. 3. Declarations of expenditure shall be drawn up in accordance with the model in Annex XI. In the case of rural development programmes covering regions benefiting from different rates of co-financing in accordance with Article 70(3) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, the application shall include a separate table of expenditure for each type of region. 4. Where there are disagreements, differences of interpretation or inconsistencies relating to declarations of expenditure for a reference period, resulting in particular from the failure to communicate the information required under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 and its implementing rules, and these require further checks, the Member State concerned shall be required to provide additional information. Such information shall be provided by means of the secure system for the exchange of information referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 15 of this Regulation. The time limit for payment laid down in Article 26(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 may in such cases be interrupted for all or part of the amount for which payment is claimed, from the date on which the request for information is sent until receipt of the information requested but no later than the date on which the declaration of expenditure for the following period is submitted. Where no solution is found within that time limit, the Commission may suspend or reduce payments in accordance with Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. 5. Cumulative data relating to expenditure and assigned revenue that can be charged to a financial year, to be submitted to the Commission by 10 November at the latest, may be corrected only in the annual accounts to be sent to the Commission in accordance with Article 8(1)(c)(iii) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. Article 17 Calculation of the amount to be paid 1. The Community contribution to be paid in respect of the eligible public expenditure declared for each priority for each reference period shall be calculated on the basis of the financing plan in force on the first day of that period. 2. The amounts of the EAFRD contributions recovered from beneficiaries under the rural development programme concerned during each reference period shall be deducted from the amount to be paid by the EAFRD in the declaration of expenditure for that period. 3. The greater or lesser amounts resulting, where applicable, from the clearance of accounts carried out in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 that may be re-used for the rural development programme shall be added to or deducted from the amount of the EAFRD contribution when the first declaration after the clearance of accounts decision is drawn up. 4. Without prejudice to the ceiling provided for in Article 24(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, where the combined total of declarations of expenditure exceeds the total programmed for a rural development programme priority, the amount to be paid shall be capped at the amount programmed for that priority. Public expenditure excluded as a result may be taken into account in a subsequent declaration of expenditure provided that an adjusted financing plan has been submitted by the Member State and accepted by the Commission. 5. The Community contribution shall be paid by the Commission, subject to budget availabilities, into the account(s) opened by each Member State. Each Member State shall notify the Commission of the account name or numbers in accordance with the format made available to it by the Commission. CHAPTER 4 COMMON PROVISIONS FOR THE EAGF AND EAFRD Article 18 Electronic exchange of information and documents 1. The Commission shall set up computer systems enabling electronic exchanges of documents and information between it and the Member States for the communications and consultation of information provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and arrangements for their application. It shall inform the Member States of the general conditions for implementing these systems via the Committee on the Agricultural Funds. 2. The computer systems provided for in paragraph 1 shall be able to process in particular: (a) the data required for financial transactions, in particular those relating to the monthly and annual accounts of the paying agencies, declarations of expenditure and revenue and transmission of the information and documents referred to in Articles 5, 11, 15 and 17 of this Regulation, Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 and Articles 2, 10 and 11 of Regulation (EC) No 884/2006; (b) documents of common interest enabling the accounts to be monitored and the information and documents which the paying agency must make available to the Commission to be consulted; (c) the Community texts and Commission guidelines on the financing of the common agricultural policy by authorities accredited and designated under Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, and the guidelines on the harmonised application of the legislation concerned. 3. The form and content of the documents referred to in Articles 4, 14 and 17 of this Regulation, Article 7(1)(a), (b) and (d) of Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 and Articles 10 and 11 of Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 shall be laid down by the Commission on the basis of the models in Annexes II to XI of this Regulation, in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 and in Annexe III to Regulation (EC) No 884/2006. These models shall be adapted and updated by the Commission, after having informed the Committee on the Agricultural Funds. 4. The computer systems provided for in paragraph 1 may contain the tools required for storing the data for and managing the accounts of the EAGF and EAFRD by the Commission, and those required for calculating flat-rate expenditure or expenditure requiring the use of uniform methods, in particular as regards financial costs and depreciation. 5. The data on financial transactions shall be communicated, entered and updated in the computer systems referred to in paragraph 1 under the responsibility of the paying agency, by the paying agency itself or by the body to which that function has been delegated, where applicable via the coordinating bodies accredited in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 6(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. 6. Where a document or procedure provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 or the detailed rules for its application require the signature of an authorised person or the approval of a person at one or more of the stages of that procedure, the computer systems set up for the communication of these documents must make it possible to identify each person unambiguously and provide reasonable assurance that the contents of the documents, including as regards the stages of the procedure, cannot be altered, in accordance with Community legislation. As regards the declarations of expenditure and the statement of assurance annexed to the annual accounts referred to in Article 8(1)(c)(i) and (iii) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the documents sent electronically shall also be kept in their original form by the paying agencies or, where applicable, by the coordinating bodies accredited in accordance with Article 6(2) and (3) of that Regulation. 7. The electronic and digitised documents shall be kept for the whole of the period required under Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 885/2006. 8. Where there is a malfunction in a computer system or no stable connection, the Member State may, with the prior approval of the Commission, send the documents in another form, under the conditions laid down by it. CHAPTER 5 TRANSITIONAL MEASURES AND FINAL PROVISIONS Article 19 Accounting of funds from modulation or compliance with conditions concerning the environment 1. Amounts withheld in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 or Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1655/2004 shall be credited by the Member State to a special account opened for each paying agency or to a special single account opened by each Member State. The accounts must allow identification of the origin of the credit in relation to the payment to the beneficiary of the aid in question. 2. Member States may redistribute the amounts collected as referred to in paragraph 1 to paying agencies of their choice with a view to their utilisation. Such amounts shall be credited to the account(s) referred to in paragraph 1, and used exclusively for financing the additional Community support referred to in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 or for the accompanying measures referred to in Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1655/2004. Any interest borne by the unused funds shall be added to the balance available at the end of each financial year and used to finance the same measures. 3. The paying agencies must keep accounts of expenditure on the measures referred to in paragraph 2 that are separate from the accounts of other expenditure on rural development, and the accounts must distinguish in respect of each payment between the national funding and the funding resulting from the application of Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 or Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1655/2004. 4.

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. The SPAM® Museum . SPAM marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the Chinese Year of the Pig. If the on-site ""wall of SPAM"" is any indication, a tour through the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family. SPAM's parent company, Hormel Foods, opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of SPAM. One of the main attractions is a scale model of a SPAM plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce America's favorite tinned meat. 2. National Museum of Funeral History . It's pretty hard to argue with the motto ""Any Day Above Ground is a Good One."" So goes the backhanded optimism of the National Museum of Funeral History, a Houston facility that opened in 1992. Visitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory. In addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of ""fantasy coffins"" designed by Ghanaian artist Kane Quaye. These moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken, a Mercedes-Benz, a shallot, and an outboard motor. According to Quaye, his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients, which -- let's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot. 3. The Hobo Museum . If you're bumming around but looking for a good time, be sure to take a load off in Britt, Iowa, at The Hobo Museum, which details the history and culture of tramps. Bear in mind, though, that the museum kind of, well, slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention. Luckily, tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year. Of course, if you're interested in the Hobo Convention, lodging is available all over the area, but it's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the ""hobo jungle,"" located by the railroad tracks. Both the event and the museum are operated by the Hobo Foundation, which --incidentally -- also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have ""caught the westbound"" are laid to rest. 4. The Mütter Museum . Originally, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia erected the Mütter Museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena. (You know, babies with two heads, that sort of thing.) But today, it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque. There, you'll find the world's largest colon, removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation. Also on display: an OB-GYN instrument collection, thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects. 5. The Barnum Museum . What better way to honor ""Greatest Show on Earth"" founder P.T. Barnum than with a mediocre museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut? Some visitors will appreciate the museum's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus. But only circus freaks (and by that we mean ""enthusiasts"") will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnum's 40-inch-tall sidekick, General Tom Thumb. 6. The Conspiracy Museum . There's more than one theory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well? Most JFK buffs are familiar with the Sixth Floor Museum housed in the former Texas School Book Depository, which recounts all those boring ""mainstream"" details of the late president's life leading up to his death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald. But just down the street, the Conspiracy Museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into The Man's propaganda. For the most part, the museum specializes in showings of the Zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories, including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement. 7. The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices . Take two trips to the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices and call us when you've lost all faith in the medical profession. Thanks to curator Bob McCoy (who recently donated the collection to the Science Museum of Minnesota), those in search of history's quack science can find what they're looking for in the St. Paul tourist attraction, whether it's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers. If you make the trip, be sure to check out the 1930s McGregor Rejuvenator. This clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies, sans head, in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process. 8. Cook's Natural Science Museum . What began as a training facility for Cook's Pest Control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest. At Cook's Natural Science Museum in Decatur, Alabama, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites ... all for free. And while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them, museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing Pest of the Month keep reeling in patrons. 9. Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum . So, what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville? The Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum, of course -- where dummies go to die. The Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, museum was the brainchild of the late William Shakespeare Berger, who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets. In fact, he collected figures from some of the country's most famous ventriloquist acts. And with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling, you're bound to feel like you're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one. But sadly, when Berger gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving. 10. The Trash Museum . Mom wasn't kidding when she said one man's trash is another man's treasure. At the Trash Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment! T . our the Temple of Trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump. And for your recycler-in-training, head across the state to the Children's Garbage Museum, where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile, get a glimpse of the 1-ton Trash-o-saurus, or enjoy the company of resident compost worms.

"Commission Regulation (EC) No 2772/2000 of 18 December 2000 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82 laying down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of boned meat of bovine animals THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Article 33(12) thereof, Whereas: (1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1470/2000(3), lays down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of boned meat of adult bovine animals. (2) The current rules require that all cuts produced by the boning of hindquarters, with the exception of fillet, must be exported. However, in line with the general trend on the market, the option of not exporting fillet should be extended to other cuts from hindquarters with a view to achieving better prices within the Community, without thereby jeopardising the goal of freeing the Community market. (3) Since the rate of the special refund corresponds to the average level of support for all cuts obtained from hindquarters, the decision not to export certain hindquarter cuts means that the refund needs to be adjusted, the amount of such adjustment being calculated by reference to the value of the cuts most affected. (4) Some points in the text need clarifying and other technical details need updating, in particular to replace the references to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3665/87 of 27 November 1987 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 604/98(5), by references to Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999(6), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1557/2000(7), which replaced it. (5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82 is hereby amended as follows: 1. The last sentence of Article 2(1) is deleted. 2. Article 5 is replaced by the following: ""Article 5 1. Customs formalities for export from the Community for supplies as referred to in Article 36 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999(8) or for products placed under the procedure referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 shall be completed in the Member State in which the declaration as referred to in Article 2 is accepted. 2. In box 11 of the 'boned meat certificate' the customs authorities shall enter the reference numbers and dates of the declarations referred to in Article 5(4) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999. Where the arrangement provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 is utilised, the customs authorities shall enter the reference numbers and dates of the payment declarations provided for in Article 26(2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999. Where necessary, those particulars may be entered on the reverse side of the certificates and certified by the customs authorities. 3. After customs formalities covering cuts for export are completed, the 'boned meat certificate' shall be sent by administrative channels to the agency responsible for paying the export refunds."" 3. Article 6 is replaced by the following: ""Article 6 1. Except in cases of force majeure, special refunds shall be granted subject to the export of the total quantity of cuts produced by boning performed under supervision in accordance with Article 2(3) and that are shown in the certificate(s) provided for in Article 4(1). 2. However, operators shall be authorised not to export the total quantity of cuts produced by boning hindquarters. If the quantity to be exported amounts to at least 95 % of the total weight of cuts produced by boning performed under supervision in accordance with Article 2(3), the special refund shall be payable. If the quantity to be exported amounts to less than 95 %, but not less than 85 %, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning, the special refund payable shall be reduced. The amount by which the rate is to be reduced shall be decided when the rate of refund concerned is fixed or altered. It shall be determined in particular in the light of the value of the various cuts that are likely to remain on the Community market. 3. Bones, large tendons, cartilage, pieces of fat and other scraps left over from boning may be marketed within the Community. 4. Operators wishing to take advantage of one of the options provided for in paragraph 2 must mention this in their declarations as provided for in Article 2(1). In addition, the certificate(s) provided for in Article 4(1) must show: - in box 4, the total net weight of the cuts produced from boning and, where applicable, the endorsement: '- Application of Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82 - 95 % option,' or '- Application of Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82 - 85 % option,' - in box 6, the net weight to be exported. The Member States may limit the number of types of cut which operators can decide not to export to two per boning operation. 5. If the quantity exported is less than the weight shown in box 6 of the certificate(s) provided for in Article 4(1), the special refund shall be reduced. The percentage reduction shall be: - where the difference between the weight exported and that shown in box 6 of the certificate(s) provided for in Article 4(1) is found not to exceed 10 %, five times the percentage difference in weight, - in other cases, 80 % of the rate of refund on products covered, as the case may be, by CN code 0201 30 00 91/00 or 0201 30 00 91/20, applicable on the date shown in box 21 of the export licence on the basis of which the formalities referred to in Article 5(1) or 26(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 have been completed.

"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two Pakistani television networks that transmit from Dubai in United Arab Emirates were ordered off the air Friday at the request of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, officials from the networks said. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has been under pressure to lift a state of emergency. GEO-TV and ARY Digital offer a variety of programming, including news, entertainment, sports and music. Both networks had been banned from Pakistan's cable television system -- along with other networks, including CNN and BBC -- since Musharraf declared a state of emergency on November 3. This latest action prevents the two Pakistani networks from broadcasting worldwide via satellite. ""This was basically our window to the world, GEO President Imran Aslan said. ""In Pakistan, we've been shut down since the 3rd."" The action was not wholly unexpected, but surprising nevertheless, Aslan said. ""We uplink from Dubai, never having had a license to uplink from Pakistan,"" he said. ""Dubai is a media city which seemed to be a haven and a sanctuary."" Aslan said network officials have been in discussions with Pakistani government officials and ""it seemed very obvious that they were going to do this. We were ready for it to a certain extent."" ""Eventually they decided to put their feet on the pipe, as it were."" The government has made numerous demands of the network, although none of them official, Aslan said. ""It's done through intermediaries,"" he said. ""[Dulling] down the content, not having certain anchors, some of the hosts of our programs and talk shows."" Musharraf's emergency order put several restrictions on the media, preventing journalists from expressing opinions prejudicial to ""the ideology ... or integrity of Pakistan."" Journalists are also restricted from covering suicide bombings and militant activity and could face three-year jail terms if they ""ridicule"" members of the government or armed forces. Almost a dozen journalists have been arrested. Musharraf has denied that his restrictions bar criticism, saying they only ask for responsibility in reporting. But last week, Pakistan expelled three print journalists for using language in an editorial that a Pakistani official called offensive to Musharraf. The editorial criticized Musharraf and the United States and Britain for continuing to support him. While many Pakistani journalists have protested the restrictions, some smaller television channels have complied with the government's restrictions. GEO and ARY have refused. ""It seems most of the other channels have kowtowed in order to survive,"" Aslan said. Musharraf has said the emergency order improves stability and will foster peaceful parliamentary elections, which he has said he would like to see take place before January 9. The exact date will be set by Pakistan's Election Commission. Opposition leaders have accused Musharraf of declaring emergency rule to keep his hold on power and avoid an expected court ruling that would have nullified his election victory in October.

"QUEBEC, Canada -- Third seed Julia Vakulenko will face comeback queen Lindsay Davenport in her first WTA Tour final at the Bell Challenge on Sunday. Julia Vakulenko will seek her first victory on the WTA Tour at the Bell Challenge in Quebec. The Ukrainian battled through with a 6-1 4-6 7-5 victory over American qualifier Julie Ditty in the semifinals. The 24-year-old, who reached the fourth round of the U.S. Open, had previously twice lost at the last-four stage this year in Las Vegas and Berlin. She reached a career high of 33rd in the world rankings back in May, but is now 36th. ""Sometimes you play your best and win easy, but sometimes you don't play your best and really have to fight hard,"" said Vakulenko, who squandered points for 5-3 leads in both the second and third sets. ""I'm just going to try my best -- I've never played her and I'm looking forward to it."" Former world No. 1 Davenport is seeking her second win in three tournaments since returning from a one-year hiatus to have a baby. The 31-year-old, who is unseeded after accepting a wild-card to enter the Canadian tournament for the first time, also had to battle to beat Russian second seed Vera Zvonareva 6-2 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 in the semifinals. The three-time Grand Slam winner has surged back up the rankings from 234th to 126th after winning her comeback tournament in Bali and then reaching the last four in Beijing. The American has now beaten Zvonareva in all six encounters between the two players. ""I played well in the first set and had some chances early in the second set, but I didn't quite capitalize on them. I was able to come back but at 4-4 and 5-5 I just didn't return well enough,"" Davenport said. ""I was happy I was able to regroup in the third set. Physically I feel good. There are lots of positives I can take from it, especially beating a really good player and now being in the final. ""I want to be the one on the offensive and not the defensive, and that's what I'm going to try to do. ""I was trying to watch the first semifinal and see if that helped, but I play so much differently than Julie Ditty that it was hard to get anything from it."" E-mail to a friend .",formal

"This was when I was in my early 20's. I didn't have car insurance on my car, except fire and theft, and my sister in law needed a ride to pick up her friend. I had been driving without insurance for two years. Anyway, I thought the guy driving behind me was being a dick driving up my ass with his brights on, so I hit the gas to get away from him and then took my left turn sharply. The car followed right behind me. At the next stop sign I didn't stop but did a u-turn so I can see who was being a douche. It was a cop cruiser, and his flashers came on. They blocked my way and stared, to see if I was gonna try and run I'd imagine. I pointed meekly at the sidewalk where I could park, so they let me while they did their own u-turn and stopped behind me. They took their time to come to the car, and when they did the first thing he asked was for my license/registration and did I have insurance? I have no idea if they know I did or not so I just said, no...just parking insurance..? They asked what I mean, I said fire and theft. He says to step out of the car. They ask me and my sister in law, separately, how we knew each other (probably to make sure she wasn't a hooker), and a whole bunch of other questions including what work did I do (which was stockroom duty/shipping at Zellers). They then tell me to wait there and they went and sat in their cruiser for a looong time. When they come back, he asks me if I know the penalty for driving without insurance was, and I said no. He told me it was between 2000-10000 fine and/or 30 days in jail. I just said, ohh... He then asked me how I was going to get home. I said I dunno...? He said that I wouldn't be allowed to drive the car home. He said he'd let me go with a warning this time, that I shouldn't do it again or they'd charge me to the fullest. Dodged a major bullet there. The next day I took a cab to my car and drove to work, and continued driving uninsured for another year, like the dumbass I was. Tl;dr: I drove without car insurance for two years, got caught, and instead of giving me a $2000-10000 fine and/or 30 days in jail they let me go with a warning.",informal
"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South African fast bowler Dale Steyn took a career-best five for 34 as the Proteas took a tight grip on the first test against New Zealand in Johannesburg. Steyn's career-best 5-34 was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. New Zealand were bowled out for 118 in reply to South Africa's 226 and the home side piled on the agony by reaching 179 for two in their second innings. Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis shared an unbeaten stand of 159 as South Africa stretched their lead to 287. South Africa's bowlers excelled to bring their side back into the game after their disappointing first innings. They snapped up five wickets in the morning session when the Kiwis could only muster 56 runs. Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming made 40 but the next best score was new cap Ross Taylor's 15. Fleming was struck on the right forearm by Steyn and did not field during the afternoon. Coach John Bracewell said he had gone for precautionary X-rays but there was only bruising. New Zealand, 41 for two overnight, lost nightwatchman Shane Bond, bowled by a Steyn yorker, before Makhaya Ntini claimed the crucial wicket of Fleming, who was well caught by AB de Villiers diving to his left at third slip. Scott Styris and Taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled. Steyn's figures bettered his previous best of five for 47 against the same opponents at Centurion two seasons ago. It was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. Ntini took three for 47 and Kallis two for 11. South Africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers Herschelle Gibbs and captain Graeme Smith out cheaply, but Amla and Kallis blunted the attack and then took charge. They batted together for 205 minutes, Amla facing 230 balls and hitting 13 boundaries in his 85 while Kallis hit 12 fours off 122 deliveries in reaching 76. The Kiwis were left to regret Brendon McCullum's failure to hold a chance from Amla off Shane Bond, when the batsman had only scored two. ""The ball was hard and new and we were trying to get momentum. It cost us a lot,"" said coach John Bracewell. E-mail to a friend .",formal

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages. (8) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 The rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 and in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003, and exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 respectively, shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some Democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious House resolution labeling Turkey's treatment of Armenians in World War I as genocide. A KC-135 tanker lands at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey in 2003. Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally and NATO partner, was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide and threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the strategically important Incirlik, military officials said Tuesday. Ankara acknowledges the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently objects to the ""genocide"" label. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. But the Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue, and some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. ""I said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here,"" said Hoyer of Maryland. ""I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions. We will have to determine where everybody is."" Democratic Rep. Ike Skelton, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, announced his opposition to the resolution last week. And Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings of Florida and John Tanner of Tennessee, both members of the U.S. House delegation to NATO, urged Pelosi to reconsider in a letter released Tuesday. ""More than half of the cargo flown into Iraq and Afghanistan comes through Incirlik Air Base, and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future,"" they wrote. Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Pentagon planners are looking at ""a broad range of options"" to keep food, fuel and ammunition flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq if Turkey blocks Incirlik. ""We're confident that we'll find ways to do that,"" Ham told reporters at the Pentagon. ""There's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that, and obviously we'd prefer to maintain the access that we have."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed lawmakers' concerns last week. ""About 70 percent of all air cargo going into Iraq goes through Turkey. ... About a third of the fuel that they consume goes through Turkey or comes from Turkey,"" Gates said. He also said that 95 percent of the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protective vehicles, or MRAPs, being deployed in Iraq are flown through Turkey. The vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs. See Incirlik's key location » . The U.S. military issued a ""warning order"" a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews, planes, fuel and routes are lined up if Turkey stops or restricts U.S. access to Incirlik, a source said. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives the United States is considering. Some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the Turks to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq which could further complicate Iraqi stability, U.S. officials said. Incirlik offers 10,000- and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters, according Globalsecurity.org, a source of background information about military issues. Globalsecurity said Incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to Iraq, taking over for Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany because it is closer to Iraq, reducing the strain on troops and aircraft.

"MEMPHIS, Tennessee (CNN) -- Three men have been arrested and charged with murder in the shooting death last week of a University of Memphis football player, Memphis police announced Monday. Police investigating a car crash on September 30 found Taylor Bradford, 21, fatally wounded near the campus residence hall area. He had apparently gotten into his car after being shot, and drove a short distance before crashing into a tree. Bradford -- a 5-foot-11, 300-pound defensive lineman from Nashville -- was pronounced dead at Regional Medical Center. Memphis Police Department Director Larry Godwin said DeeShawn Tate, 21, Victor Trezevant, 21, and Courtney Washington, 22, had been charged with murder in perpetration of attempted aggravated robbery. Homicide investigators developed the case against the three men with the help of a citizen's tip and Crimestoppers, he said. Godwin said the investigation continues, and ""we do expect additional arrests in this case."" ""It was an attempted robbery, aggravated robbery,"" he said. Bradford ""was targeted because of some information that was out there and the fact that they believed he had some cash, or he had something that they wanted."" Godwin said none of the three arrested suspects were students at the university, but he would not rule out that other suspects could be students. Shelby County District Attorney General William L. Gibbons said the three suspects would make an initial court appearance as early as Tuesday. He said prosecutors were considering seeking the death penalty in the case, but no decision had been made. ""Whether or not it will be would be premature for me to say,"" Gibbons said. ""There are a lot of factors that go into it. We'll make a determination at the appropriate time."" Officials at the 21,000-student school said Bradford, a marketing major who lived on campus, was popular with the football team and on the campus as a whole. He had transferred from Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, and was 36 credit hours short of graduation. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (CNN) -- The acrimony from the Republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the CNN/YouTube GOP presidential debate Wednesday. The debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. With five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season, the Republican candidates engaged in a free-for-all, trying to differentiate their views on immigration, the Iraq war, abortion, gun control and even whether they believed every word in the Bible was true. Unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Wednesday night's attacks were launched at each other. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney traded jabs over illegal immigration, something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month. Romney attacked Giuliani's record, saying that as mayor, he promoted illegal immigration. And Giuliani shot back, accusing Romney of having a ""sanctuary mansion"" at his own home. Watch the debate format produce raw moments » . ""In his case, there were six sanctuary cities. He did nothing about them. There was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home, illegal immigrants were being employed,"" Giuliani said. Romney denied Giuliani's allegation, and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other. In his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party, Romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has been rising in the polls. Rep. Tom Tancredo, who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration, seemed delighted with the give and take, saying the other candidates were trying to ""out-Tancredo"" him. Huckabee drew one of the night's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the Internal Revenue Service. ""Most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging, and there's a reason why,"" he said. Sen. John McCain, freshly back from a visit to Iraq over Thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates, and Rep. Ron Paul, the most anti-war of the candidates, tangled on two occasions over the Iraq war. Did YouTubers get their questions answered? » . Asked which government programs they would cut, Paul said bringing the troops home from Iraq would save ""a trillion dollars."" McCain said: ""It's that kind of isolationism that caused World War II,"" which drew some hoots from the crowd. Watch McCain, Paul spar on Iraq » . Paul replied: ""The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel?"" A retired brigadier general, Keith Kerr, who is gay, asked candidates if they thought U.S. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops. CNN later learned that a June media release from the campaign of Democratic front-runner Clinton listed Kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters. Watch Kerr deny that the Clinton campaign influenced his question » . David Bohrman, CNN senior vice president and executive producer of the debate, said, ""We regret this incident. CNN would not have used the general's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate."" Political Ticker . Kerr told CNN after the debate that he has not worked for the Clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself. Kerr also said he is a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay and lesbian Republican grass-roots organization. Prior to the debate, CNN had verified Kerr's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate. In a section of the debate about gun ownership rights, three of the GOP presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns: McCain, Giuliani and Romney. Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson quipped, ""I own a couple of guns -- but I'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are."" Watch the candidates address gun control » . The debate turned personal when a viewer, holding the Bible, asked: ""Do you believe every word of this book? And I mean specifically, this book that I am holding in my hand."" Huckabee, a Baptist minister, said, ""Sure, I believe the Bible is exactly what it is."" Giuliani said he believes the Bible, but not ""literally true in every respect."" After that, Romney stammered a bit when moderator Anderson Cooper asked him if he believed every word. Watch the candidates get personal about the Bible » . ""Yeah, the Bible is the word of God. ... I might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word, but I read the Bible and I believe the Bible is the word of God,"" Romney said. When asked about abortion, Romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of Massachusetts. ""If people in this country are looking for someone who's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they're ever wrong, they're going to have to find somebody else. On abortion, I was wrong,"" he said. His remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by Thompson's campaign, which included a clip of Romney expressing support for Roe vs. Wade during a 1994 debate against Sen. Ted Kennedy. When asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal, Paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government. ""We don't need a federal abortion police, that's the last thing we need,"" Paul said. He added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities. On the issues of taxes, Thompson said he'd ""never met a tax he liked."" ""I've got a tax-cut bill on the table. But I don't do pledges to anybody but the American people,"" he said. His response was met by a ""Go, Fred, go!"" from a member of the audience. On the issue of trade with China, Rep. Duncan Hunter said China is ""cheating on trade ... and it's in the interest of the United States to stop China's cheating. Buy American this Christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job."" The candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the YouTube Web site, just as Democratic White House candidates did in July. The debate was the first time the GOP candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. CNN's political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the GOP debate -- about 2,000 more than they saw for the Democrats' debate. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan's economy. Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007. The report from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006. Despite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said. Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground. The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year. According to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade. Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001. ""Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,"" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. ""Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source."" James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. ""We share the U.N.'s concerns,"" Appathurai told CNN. ""Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation."" He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. ""The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,"" Appathurai said. Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said. However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked. According to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes. Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region. He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors. ""Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,"" the U.N. drug chief said. Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. ""You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,"" he said. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"MADRID, Spain -- Atletico Madrid recovered from their painful recent defeat by Barcelona to crush European rivals Real Zaragoza 4-0 in the Primera Liga on Sunday. Luis Garcia celebrates his first Atletico Madrid goal in their superb 4-0 victory over Real Zaragoza. Luis Garcia's first goal for the club, a double from Argentine Maxi Rodriguez and a Diego Forlan strike clinched a comfortable win as Atletico moved up to sixth in the table. It was also sweet revenge for Atletico as Zaragoza beat them home and away last season to beat them to sixth place and the final UEFA Cup spot. Atletico went ahead in the 10th minute when Forlan picked out a precise pass for Garcia who made no mistake with a calm side-footed finish. Forlan then got on the scoresheet himself with a first-time lob on 34 minutes for his third goal of the season, before Rodriguez stole the show with two more goals. Getafe registered their first win of the season with a 2-0 victory over Murcia. Substitute Kepa, who was later sent off, opened the scoring in the 54th minute and Francisco Casero added a second five minutes later to clinch the points. Elsewhere last season's second division champions Valladolid continue to struggle in the top flight, crashing to a 2-1 defeat against Athletic Bilbao. Artiz Aduriz scored twice for Bilbao after eight and 31 minutes to leave Valladolid second from bottom with promoted Levante, who have a meagre one point, propping up the table.

"CARACAS, Venezuela (CNN) -- The price of sin rose Monday in Venezuela where President Hugo Chavez is on a campaign to make Venezuelans cut back on drinking and smoking. ""Everyone's shocked,"" said Leonora Marino, owner of Bodegon Marino in Valencia, Venezuela, west of Caracas. On Monday evening, she was still changing the prices in her store as her customers looked on and complained, she told a reporter. Alcohol is now 10 percent more expensive; cigarettes are 20 percent pricier. ""Really, it's difficult to buy at these prices,"" she said, then joked, ""They say they're going to stop eating so that they can continue drinking."" The Venezuelan government is placing a higher tax on alcohol and cigarettes in an effort to cut consumption and prevent what it views as the social, economic and moral consequences of drinking and smoking, said Jose Vielma Mora, superintendent of Seniat, the government body that oversees the collection of taxes. Taxes on whiskey, brandy, cognac and other drinks that don't come from cane sugar have been raised $1.79 (3,838 bolivares) per liter, the government-run Bolivarian News Agency said. ""It's unfair because, in the end, the consumer is the one who pays,"" said Fernando Fernandez, a liquor exporter. Chavez has described whiskey as a drink for rich people, not for revolutionaries. ""We cannot be spending the international reserves of this country on whiskey,"" he said. The moves represent the first steps toward transforming each Venezuelan into what Chavez calls ""the new man."" Chavez has cited the life of revolutionary socialist icon Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara as an example of how to lead a more pure life. In April, Chavez told a graduating class of medical students in Caracas, Venezuela, that the level of consumption of alcohol in the country represents a threat to public health and ought to make residents feel ashamed, according to an ABN report. ""The vice causes much harm, not only to individuals, but to the collective health of the nation,"" said Chavez, who said the dangers result in an increase in car wrecks and domestic violence. For his part, he has said he drinks too much coffee. Also effective Monday, stores near schools, churches and cultural centers will not be granted licenses to sell alcohol. Taxes on cigarette imports have also increased, from 50 percent to 70 percent of the total price. On the street, some people said they don't understand the motivations for the increase, but predicted their consumption would not change. ""The Venezuelan is not going to stop drinking or smoking,"" said one person. Chavez also plans to increase taxes on luxury items such as Hummers, which are imported privately and at great expense. There is no Hummer dealership in the country. Higher oil prices in recent years have translated into higher consumption in petroleum-rich Venezuela. Last year, car sales increased by about 70 percent, according to the CIA World Factbook. But Chavez, who was in Cuba on Monday visiting communist leader Fidel Castro, said he wants to focus less on material goals for Venezuela's 27 million people, 38 percent of whom live in poverty.

"This is how many Ukrainians start and finish their summer holiday in Russian-annexed Crimea. Queues of cars snake for several hours as people wait to visit relatives or get to the peninsula for a beach break. Lorry-loads of watermelons are sold by the side of the road while people wait to be checked or waved through, in the southern region of Kherson, next to Crimea, where Kiev's vast Dnipro river enters the Black Sea. Aside from the odd soldier dug in by the side of the road and the vigilance of Ukraine's border guards, there is little to suggest that the country is preparing for Russian military action from the south. Most analysts think any such action would be highly unlikely. But after Russia seized Crimea in March 2014 without firing a shot, Ukraine has learnt to expect the unexpected from its powerful neighbour. Vigilance is the watchword of Ukraine's National Border Guard. Spokesman Ivan Shevcov said his colleagues were ""prepared for any type of action from the Russian side"". The war of words between Russia and Ukraine has intensified following Moscow's accusation that Kiev plotted a sabotage attack in Crimea. Russian President Vladimir Putin promised a response. Russia has moved more military hardware on to the peninsula. And pictures of the Russian navy carrying out military drills in Crimea to counter the threat of saboteurs were quickly beamed around the world. This week Russia is carrying out more exercises in Crimea to counter the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has put his military on high alert. He insists the Russian claim of a sabotage attack by Ukrainian special forces was cooked up by the Kremlin to justify future attacks. However little, if anything, has changed at the checkpoints in and out of Crimea. One man from the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa said he went there only to visit his elderly mother who lived there and wouldn't leave. When she dies, he will not travel there any more. For Igor, travelling to Crimea to visit relatives, the latest rhetoric is ""mostly exaggerated"". ""Whatever you see on TV, (with) saboteur groups arrested, I think this can be faked by any side. Each side can create provocations."" With his tennis racket bag slung over his shoulder, Artyom, a Ukrainian probably in his 20s, explains how pleasant his holiday in Crimea has been, and how friendly the people there were. And he is not alone. ""The Russians say one thing and the Ukrainians another. I don't know who to trust,"" says an elderly woman with sunglasses. The line between fact and fiction is often blurred when it comes to Russia's tactics and actions in relation to Ukraine. Kiev calls this ""hybrid warfare"", which mixes propaganda with cyber attacks and semi-clandestine operations. Tamara is driving across to Crimea, where she owns property, with her chihuahua Charlie. She might not believe all the rumours in Kiev. However, she does not trust the Russian version of recent events. ""I think [the Russians] did this intentionally. But I don't know why they did this during the holiday season. Everything was fine when I came here in June with my mum."" Tamara's mother-in-law and daughter were going to join her on the trip to Crimea, but because of what they had seen on the news they decided to stay in Kiev. Across the water from Crimea in the small town of Skadovsk, the melee of swimsuits and food-sellers on the beach is proof that many Ukrainians will simply not travel to Russian-annexed Crimea as a point of principle. Few seem to notice the Ukrainian National Border Guard soldiers high above in their concrete look-out post at the back of the beach, behind an invisible network of trenches. For all the political rhetoric of recent days, the fun-loving normality of the summer season in southern Ukraine goes on.",formal
"(Mental Floss) -- 1. The Hamburger -- Louis' Lunch, New Haven, Connecticut . This burger did not come from Louis' so ketchup is OK. There are competing claims for the coveted ""Inventor of the Hamburger"" title, but according to Louis' Lunch (and the Library of Congress, for that matter), this small New Haven restaurant takes the prize. The story goes something like this: One day in 1900, a rushed businessman asked owner Louis Lassen for something quick that he could eat on the run. Lassen cooked up a beef patty, put it between some bread, and sent the man on his way. Pretty modest beginnings for arguably the most popular sandwich of all-time, huh? If you visit Louis' today, you'll find that not much has changed. The Lassen family still owns and operates the restaurant, the burgers are still cooked in ancient gas stoves, and, just like then, there is absolutely no ketchup allowed. 2. The Fried Twinkie -- The ChipShop, Brooklyn, New York . Sometimes what counts isn't being the inventor, it's being the innovator. Take the fried Twinkie, for example. The Twinkie -- in all its indestructible glory-- has been around for ages, but when ChipShop owner Christopher Sell had the brilliant idea to freeze the snack, dip it in batter, and deep-fry it, the Twinkie took gluttony to new heights. Even The New York Times raved about how ""something magical"" happens when you taste the deep-fried Twinkie's ""luscious vanilla flavor."" Sell, who was trained in classical French cuisine, didn't start with the Twinkie, though. In his native England, he fried up everything from M&M's to Mars bars. 3. Root Beer Float -- Myers Avenue Red Soda Co., Cripple Creek, Colorado . If you thought what happened up on Cripple Creek only happened in song, you're sorely mistaken. In August of 1893, a failed gold-miner-turned-soda-company-owner named Frank J. Wisner was drinking a bottle of his Myers Avenue Red root beer while looking up at Cow Mountain. Just then, a full moon illuminated the snowcap on the otherwise black mountain, and Wisner had a brilliant idea -- float a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a glass of his root beer. The new drink was christened the ""black cow"" and became an instant classic. Today, of course, most of us call it a root beer float. 4. Corn Dogs -- Cozy Dog Drive In, Springfield, Illinois . In 1946, Ed Waldmire, Jr., revolutionized the stick-meat world when he debuted the Cozy Dog -- the first corn dog on a stick. At first, he wanted to call his creation the ""Crusty Cur,"" but his wife convinced him to change the name to ""Cozy Dog."" She felt people wouldn't want to eat something described as ""crusty."" Good call, Mrs. Waldmire. Shortly after the Cozy Dog's inception, the Cozy Dog Drive In opened alongside old Route 66 and has been serving up corn dogs ever since. 5. The Pizzeria -- Lombardi's, New York City, New York . Pizza has existed in one form or another for a long time, but America got her first true pizzeria when Gennaro Lombardi opened up a small grocery store in New York City's Little Italy. An employee named Anthony ""Totonno"" Pero started selling pizzas out of the back, and in no time, Lombardi's was concentrating on its burgeoning pizza business instead of plain old groceries. In 1905, the establishment was licensed as a pizzeria, and it's stayed that way ever since. Well, almost. The original restaurant closed in 1984 but reopened down the street 10 years later. On its 100th anniversary in 2005, Lombardi's decided to offer its pizza for the same price it'd been sold for in 1905 -- 5 cents a pie. Needless to say, the line wrapped around the block. 6. Fat Darrell -- R.U. Hungry, New Brunswick, New Jersey . You may not know what the Fat Darrell is, but when you hear what it contains, you'll understand why it's truly a work of inspired genius. Since 1979, Rutgers University has played host to a collection of mobile food vans collectively known as the ""Grease Trucks."" Originally, they served a sandwich called the Fat Cat, which contained two cheeseburger patties, French fries, lettuce, tomato, and onions. Then one night in 1997, a hungry (and broke) student named Darrell W. Butler convinced one of the vendors to put chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, French fries, and marinara sauce on a sandwich. Strangely, the concoction sounded so appetizing that the next 10 people in line ordered it, and the Fat Darrell became a mainstay at the Grease Trucks. Hey, not any old sandwich gets to be named Maxim magazine's top ""Meat Hog"" sandwich. 7. Philly Cheesesteak -- Pat's King Of Steaks, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Philadelphia is known for many things (Ben Franklin, the Liberty Bell, and Rocky, for starters), but fine dining is not really its forte. That's OK, though, because Philly is the home of Pat's King of Steaks, and Pat's King of Steaks is where the Philly cheesesteak was born. One day back in 1932, hot dog stand owners Pasquale (Pat) and Harry Olivieri decided to change things up and make a steak sandwich with onions. A cab driver who ate at Pat's daily insisted on trying the new sandwich, and with the first bite declared, ""Hey, forget 'bout those hot dogs, you should sell these!"" Cab drivers know fast food about as well as anyone, so the brothers did just what the cabbie suggested. In no time, the modest stand turned into the Pat's that exists today. Controversy remains, however, over who's responsible for putting the cheese in cheesesteak. Pat's claims it was the first to do so (in 1951), but across-the-street rival Joe Vento of Geno's Steaks (opened 1966) insists he added the finishing touches. 8. Onion Rings -- Pig Stand, Dallas, Texas . According to most sources, the onion ring was invented when a careless cook at a Pig Stand location in Dallas accidentally dropped an onion slice in some batter, then pulled it out and tossed it in the fryer for lack of a better destination. Now, you'd think inventing the onion ring would be enough for one restaurant chain, but not Pig Stand. The company also lays claim to opening America's first drive-in, inventing Texas toast, and being one of the first restaurants to advertise using neon signs. Not bad for a little outfit from Texas. 9. Derby Pie -- Melrose Inn, Prospect, Kentucky . A Kentucky favorite, derby pie is a chocolate and pecan tart with a pastry-dough crust -- and that's about all we know about it. Why? Because the recipe is jealously guarded by the Kern family. Melrose Inn manager George Kern created derby pie in the mid-1950s with help from his parents, Walter and Leaudra, and the dessert was such a hit that the family was soon baking the treat full-time. In fact, Mrs. Kern, being the crafty monopolist she was, copyrighted the name, and to this day, you can only get real ""Derby-Pie®"" through Kern's Kitchen, Inc. Not only that, but a man from New England once handed Leaudra a blank check for the recipe so that his daughter could make the pie at home. She refused.I E-mail to a friend .

"Belgian cyclist Demoitie died after a collision with a motorbike during Belgium's Gent-Wevelgem race. The 25-year-old was hit by the motorbike after several riders came down in a crash as the race passed through northern France. ""The main issues come when cars or motorbikes have to pass the peloton and pass riders,"" Team Sky's Rowe said. ""That is the fundamental issue we're looking into. ""There's a lot of motorbikes in and around the race whether it be cameras for TV, photographers or police motorbikes. ""In total there's around 50 motorbikes that work on each race. ""We've got a riders union and we're coming together to think of a few ideas, whether we cap a speed limit on how fast they can overtake us. ""Say we put a 10 kilometres per hour limit on it, if we're going 50kph they're only allowed to pass us 60kph or something like that."" Demoitie, who was riding for the Wanty-Gobert team, was taken to hospital in Lille but died later. The sport's governing body, the UCI, said it would co-operate with all relevant authorities in an investigation into the incident. The Professional Cyclists' Association (CPA) issued a statement asking what would be done to improve safety. Despite Demoitie's death, attitudes to road racing will stay the same says Rowe, who has been competing in Three Days of De Panne race in Belgium. ""As soon as that element of fear slips into your mind and you start thinking of things that could happen, that's when you're doomed to fail,"" he told BBC Wales Sport. ""If you start thinking about crashes and the consequences and what could potentially happen then you're never going to be at the front of the peloton and you're never going to win any races.""

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Congolese refugees fled camps Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area, the U.N. refugee agency said. Refugees move along a road Tuesday in Mugunga, near Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A press release from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it didn't appear rebels had targeted the camps, but it reported some were looted after camp residents, classified as internally displaced persons, fled. Roads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting, the UNHCR reported. Torrential rain made the movement even more difficult. ""The main road toward Sake was crowded with people; we had difficulties getting through,"" UNHCR field safety adviser Pierre Nazroo was quoted as saying in the agency's release. ""Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma."" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said, ""They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway. Now they have nothing but what they can carry."" Redmond added, ""These are people in poor health; they are soaking wet because of the torrential downpours. They need shelter, they need water, they need a lot of assistance so we're going to have to move quickly to get that help to them because a lot of them are already in a weakened state."" While the Congolese government accused troops under rebel general Laurent Nkunda of staging the attack, a Nkunda spokesman denied the allegation, according to a report from the Integrated Regional Information Networks, a U.N.-affiliated news service. The spokesman, Bwambale Kakolele, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who also operate in the area were behind the attack, that report said. A spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo said it was uncertain which group attacked the Congo army outpost near the village of Kishangazi, according to the U.N.-affiliated news service. ""We think it could have been insurgents close to Nkunda who attacked, but we cannot rule out the [Rwandan rebels],"" spokesman Col. Pierre Cherayron was quoted as saying. The UNHCR identified the affected camps as Mugunga I, Mugunga II, Lac Vert and Bulengo, saying about 28,000 had abandoned the first three camps and about 2,000 had left Bulengo. The UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year. In the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said. North Kivu is in eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Congolese President Joseph Kabila has tried to gain a cease-fire with the rebels in the area under Nkunda, but fighting continues as hard-liners among the rebels and in the government have blocked reconciliation efforts, according to the International Crisis Group, an nongovernmental organization looking for solutions to conflicts.

"In the press release for the new record The Systems Are Failing, the musician writes: ""We're destroying the world, and we're still miserable. Fat, sick, stupid and anxious are no ways to live. ""These systems are failing. Let them fail. Change or die."" What makes this different from a Moby album? I think a lot of people think of me as making sort of down-tempo quiet, electronic living room music and this record is much more of a fast, aggressive post-punk record and, based on the reactions I've had so far, people have been a little nonplussed at that. What reactions specifically? Do people think you're crazy or are they applauding a brave new direction? Both in equal measure, part of what led me to want to make a record like this, is the awareness that people don't really buy records any more and people especially don't buy records from 51-year-old musicians who are making their 15th record, so with those two things in mind there's also a sense of emancipation that comes with that. You can either bemoan the fact that, in 2016 the audience for albums is quite small, but I see it as being really liberating because there's no external pressure at all. I'm not trying to sell records, I'm not trying to get on the radio, I'm honestly just trying to make a record that excites me and that I think is interesting. You've been very commercially successful and some might say that puts you in the privileged position of not having to worry about it. Yes and it would be hard for me to argue that. I would feel absurdly presumptuous criticising anyone else's choices, there are a lot of musicians who have children or alimony payments or sick relatives, so they need to make commercial compromises in order to pay the rent. I'm lucky because I live a relatively simple life and I can make whatever music I want to make without any worry about any commercial ramifications. In your mission statement for this project you state: 'When some of my middle-aged compatriots try to accommodate the pop market place, the results are so anodyne and depressing'. Did you have someone specific in mind? I did have people in mind but, in the interest of avoiding public feuds, I can't even begin to name names because in the course of my life, whenever I've criticised a fellow musician, it has ended up being something that I have truly regretted. But the truth is that a majority of musicians as they age don't do so in a graceful way. What I mean by that is, I understand that as you age, you want to hold on to your glory days and for most musicians that was decades ago, so you find yourself dressing the same way and touring and taking out your contact lenses so the audience will be blurry and look bigger than it is. If I don't have to go down that route, I'd just as soon not. But your album Play was the first album to have every track licensed to advertisers - if a corporation came to you now and asked to use Don't Leave Me from the new album - what would you do? I have a feeling that on my death bed the last question someone asks me before I die will be about licensing music to advertisements. At this point, most of what I do and I hesitate to say this because it does sound a little self-aggrandising but it's sincere, is that most of the work I do now is non-profit. I own a restaurant in LA and 100% of the profits goes to animal welfare charities and my only show this year is a fundraiser for an animal rights group. I don't mean that in a self-congratulatory way, I just mean my criteria has changed. How do my choices benefit the causes that I care about? So, if an advertiser came to me with a dump truck full of money to license a song, I would probably say ""yes"" and simply direct the dump truck to one of the organisations I work with. I've always tried to employ that ethos when it comes to advertising, like ""rob from the rich and give to the poor"" or, more accurately, ""take from corporations and give to those who work against those corporations"". But even when I was being crucified for that, I really didn't want to talk about it because it seemed defensive. It made me uncomfortable trying to justify myself even if there was justification there. With that and the Pacific Void manifesto, it sounds like you're having a conscientious mid-life crisis but, instead of buying a sports car, you're trying to right the world's wrongs. I've always been potentially an annoying, opinionated loudmouth. I was raised by very active hippies with an idea that whatever you do, in so far as you can, you should try and make the world a better place. Again, I can't be so presumptuous to say I am making it a better place but at least I want to try. There's so much, especially in the public arena, of this shameless, endless self-promotion that it just makes me nauseous. I don't want to be like them, there are too many horrifying pressing issues. Just putting out a new fashion line or lending your name to a perfume company would be fine if the world wasn't an inch away from catastrophe. Is this your main creative drive now or will you go back to recording under Moby? I made a record about two years ago that was very choral and so I used the name The Void Pacific Choir, which is a DH Lawrence quote because I liked it, but I scrapped the album and then started work on this one but I kept the name. But the truth is that it's me on my own so if I go back and record something under my name, it all seems kind of arbitrary to me. Do you intend on touring the new album? Dear God no. It's another thing that's emancipating . Most musicians put out a record with the intent of touring and my intention is to never tour again as long as I live because I hate touring. I love playing music but going to the same airports and the same hotels and the law of diminishing returns, as you age you play smaller venues and you try and play new songs but the audience just want to hear the hits which I understand because when I go to see middle-aged musicians, I want to see the hits. But if I never ever go on tour again, I would be very happy. Have you said everything you need to with this album? I've already made the follow-up record, I'm just trying to figure out when my record label will let me release it. Part two is all ready to go but clearly record companies don't love middle-aged musicians who refuse to tour, so I can't be too haughty and high-handed with them. I have to rely on their good graces. The debut album by Moby & The Void Pacific Choir is released 14 October 2016.

"(CNN) -- With his hands and feet shackled and his face obscured by his long hair, Chester Arthur Stiles made his initial court appearance in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Wednesday morning on charges stemming from the videotaped rape of a 2-year-old girl. Chester Stiles appears Wednesday in a Las Vegas, Nevada, courtroom. Stiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving. Prosecutors added a couple more charges before Wednesday's hearing, bringing the total to 23 felony counts, including a charge of lewdness with a minor, sexual assault and the use of a child in the production of pornography, according to a statement issued by the Clark County, Nevada, court. One of the lewdness charges stems from a 2004 incident, while the others are related to the videotape, the court said. Judge Deborah Lippis set November 19 as the date for the preliminary hearing. After the hearing, Stiles' court-appointed attorney said his client was overwhelmed by the public opinion in the case. ""I think he's a little out of it,"" public defender Jeff Banks said. Jerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred. The girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search. The girl's mother said on ""The Dr. Phil Show"" Wednesday that she was ""relieved"" about Stiles' arrest, although it would have been ""better if they found him dead."" The woman said she will testify against Stiles if the case goes to court. She told Phil McGraw that her daughter remembers nothing about the videotaped assault and that she recently had a conversation with the girl about inappropriate touching. She said her daughter told her that if someone touched her inappropriately, the girl would scream and tell her mother. But, she told McGraw, ""I don't trust anybody now."" Although she is in a relationship with a man her daughter calls ""Dad,"" she said, ""I don't feel comfortable leaving her with him, nor with anybody else. ... I just cry and blame it on myself."" Eight-and-a-half months pregnant, she said the incident has placed a lot of strain on her. Asked if she would rather not have known about the assault, she said, ""Yes, I could have lived without knowing it."" A former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. ""I've had my share of nightmares,"" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace. Thomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a ""weapons enthusiast"" with only a minor criminal record. Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos » . ""How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,"" Thomas said. Another former girlfriend of Stiles', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is ""mortified"" by the allegations against him. ""He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,"" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim. Todd Allen, Tina Allen's son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Ed Payne and Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.",formal
"Media playback is not supported on this device It's 1997 and ID7 television are filming at Dunkirk rugby club in northern France. Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop. ""Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter."" For four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker. Cotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less. He's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch. He has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years. Cotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. ""I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,"" he says. I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here ""I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other."" He tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been ""scuffles"" and Lourdes had come off second best. ""Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,"" Cotter recounts. ""The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up. ""There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight. ""It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards."" Years later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important. Eight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final. In 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game. Clermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland? ""It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,"" he explains. ""One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog. ""Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick. ""Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors. ""Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche. ""Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly."" In Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored. Media playback is not supported on this device Scotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations. ""The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,"" says Cotter. ""It was about creating clarity. ""The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting. ""You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win. ""There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks."" Media playback is not supported on this device On the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. ""We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,"" Cotter recalls. ""We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two. ""It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him."" Beyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks. ""We know that these teams are very good,"" he insists. ""When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit."" Five more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says. When the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby. There had been little hint of it, no suggestion his time was coming to an end. He would have preferred to stay on, but Gregor Townsend was ready for an elevation and there was only one way that was going to happen. Will he miss it? ""Undoubtedly, but we'll come back on holiday,"" he says. ""You never know, you might find that Glasgow are in Montpellier's pool next year in European rugby. ""It was always going to be the deal. The SRU had made it known at the outset that they'd like a Scottish coach in the national position sooner or later and I respect entirely the decision. Would I have liked to continue? Yeah, probably would have, but that's the way it is."" Cotter, without doubt, has been good for Scotland but he says Scotland has been good for him, too. ""I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here,"" he explains. ""I recognise it in our rural communities. ""I'm not an extroverted person - I'm introverted, I'm quiet - and I love the countryside, I love what Scotland has got to offer, whether it's the coastline, the mountains, the rivers. I enjoyed my time in Colonsay, fishing on the west coast in Plockton, stalking in Glen Shiel. ""We've got some good friends in the Borders who love their rugby and it's nice to see their passion. They talk about passion in France, but there's some real passion here for the game. ""It's been a privilege, the whole thing. I've only got fond memories. I move on. The game has existed in this country for over a hundred years and it will exist long after I've left. There's another project to move to after I finish here. We were going to go back to New Zealand but then Montpellier came up. They wanted something constructed and the communication I had with the president convinced me that there was perhaps another adventure to take on."" More than anything he wants to exit on a high. In the coming weeks he says he wants the team to deliver moments that will bond them together not just in the here and now but for decades down the road. ""They give everything, these guys,"" he adds. ""They're striving to give people something to be proud of. The stadium is a sell-out for Ireland. So, game on...""",formal

"The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as ""fuel shortage in a film"", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious. Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot). American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault. Pictures of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations led people to incorporate the term into film titles. Tom and Jerrrycan, Jerrycan Beauty and Catch Me If You Jerrycan were the result. Another obvious target was Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 film Drive which social media users changed to Walk and Drive Pas. Read more about France's controversial new labour laws",formal

"KIEV, Ukraine -- Serbian central defender Nemanja Vidic has convinced Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson that he should play in Tuesday's Champions League clash away to Dynamo Kiev. Vidic clashes with Roma goalkeeper Gianluca Curci during the UEFA Champions League Group F match. The former Spartak Moscow player sat out Saturday's 4-1 victory at Aston Villa after suffering concussion during the Premier League win over Wigan immediately before the international break. However, he has made a good recovery and will now partner Rio Ferdinand in the heart of the United defense. Injury-plagued French striker Louis Saha definitely misses the tie with a long-term knee problem and fellow casualties Gary Neville and Owen Hargreaves also stayed behind. England striker Wayne Rooney, who scored twice against Villa and was also on target in England's Euro 2008 defeat against Russia in Moscow last week, will partner Carlos Tevez in attack. A third successive victory after 1-0 wins against Sporting Lisbon and Roma would virtually guarantee United a place in the knock-out stage. United flew to Kiev a day earlier than normal, taking their own chefs and dieticians with them. ""The travel is always the biggest worry in these situations,"" said Ferguson. ""Ukraine is further away than most other journeys around Europe."" Senegal defender Pape Diakhate, Guinea forward Ismael Bangoura and Ukraine midfielder Taras Mykhalyk are expected to return for Dynamo, but former Tottenham forward Serhiy Rebrov is an absentee. Dynamo warmed up for Tuesday night with a 1-0 win over strugglers Zakarpattia on Saturday in the Ukrainian Championship. But Kiev are bottom of Group F after losing their first two games -- 2-0 at Roma and 2-1 at home to Sporting. Glasgow Rangers are without Jean-Claude Darcheville and Brahim Hemdani for their formidable home clash against Barcelona on Tuesday. Darcheville is still struggling with a hamstring problem while Hemdani misses the Group E tie in Glasgow with a groin problem that kept him out of the weekend's 3-0 win against Celtic. UEFA Cup favorites Bayern Munich will probably have to do without midfielder Franck Ribery for their group game against Red Star Belgrade on Thursday.

"An operation to pump 3,000 tonnes of water out of the Hoegh Osaka is expected to last until Sunday. But poor weather conditions has made it unsafe for the salvors to board on Saturday to finalise pumping arrangements. High winds of up to 83mph during the night caused the vessel to drag anchor for approximately 100 metres. The ship had been anchored to help control its movement. Salvage company Svitzer described working conditions on board as ""difficult"". The Hoegh Osaka has been secured two miles (3.2km) east of the Bramble Bank sandbank from which it freed itself on Wednesday. Water, described as being ""lightly contaminated with oil"" is being pumped from the ship's hold, which salvers say will cause the ship's 50-degree list to decrease. The film of oil on the water is believed to have come from vehicles held within the hold. With no power from the ship's generators, the water is being discharged using portable pumps during daylight hours. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said there was no evidence of any pollution. Divers are also waiting until conditions improve to complete an inspection of the hull which began yesterday. The Queen's Harbour Master has introduced an exclusion zone of 984ft (300m) around the vessel, currently held by tugs between Cowes and Lee-on-Solent. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: ""I've got confidence the salvors can discharge the bulk of the water from sucking underneath the oil and that will leave us with a small quantity of oil on board the vessel."" The 51,000-tonne vehicle transporter ""refloated"" itself unexpectedly at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday due to the high tide. It was towed two miles east of Bramble Bank, where it was grounded on Saturday. At a news conference on Tuesday, Bram Sperling of Svitzer, said there was some water inside because of a ""small opening in the vessel"" that had since been closed. A refloat was the preferred option to avoid further damage to the ship from the sandbank. Salvage experts boarded the ship on Monday and began carrying out an assessment to form a rescue plan. The Singapore-registered transporter set sail for Germany at about 20:20 on Saturday, shortly before being deliberately run aground by the crew after it unexpectedly started to list. There were 1,400 cars on board, including 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and 65 Minis, as well as 105 JCB machines and 500 tonnes of fuel. Two crew members out of 25 rescued by RNLI Lifeboats and the Solent Coastguard on Saturday suffered non-life threatening injuries.

"SHANGHAI, China -- Championship leader Lewis Hamilton spun out of the Chinese Grand Prix to send the world title race to a cliffhanger finale in Brazil on October 21. A disconsolate Lewis Hamilton leaves his car after spinning into the gravel trap in Shanghai. Rookie Hamilton can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race, but saw his 12-point lead cut to four by McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso in Shanghai. The Spaniard finished second behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of Hamilton. The young Briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led Raikkonen by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions. However, the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires, which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let Finland's Raikkonen take the lead. And when Hamilton -- who won in Japan last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane, he spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go. Raikkonen and Alonso both switched to dry tires on the 32nd of the 56 laps, with the Finn going on to win by by 9.8 seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both Hamilton and Alonso. Raikkone's team-mate Felipe Massa was third, while fourth place was claimed by Toro Rosso's Sebastien Vettel, who was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in Japan behind the safety car while Hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing. Britain's Jenson Button was fifth in a Honda ahead of Vettel's team-mate Vitantonio Liuzzi, while Germany's Nick Heidfeld was seventh for BMW Sauber and David Coulthard of Scotland took the final point for Red Bull. Hamilton was still confident he could bounce back after suffering his first retirement of the season. ""I'm sorry for the team but I can still do it, don't worry,"" he said. ""When I got out of the car I was just gutted because it was my first mistake all year, and to do it on the way into the pits was not something I usually do. ""You cannot go through life without making mistakes. But I am over it and we look forward to Brazil. The team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there, and we still have points in the bag. ""We were having a great race and we didn't know if it was going to rain or not. The tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas underneath. When I came into the pits it was like ice, I couldn't do anything about it."" McLaren boss Ron Dennis refused to blame his driver or his team for the spin-off. ""It's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this. It has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another Grand Prix,"" Dennis said. ""I don't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did Lewis. But the circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance. That's what made the difference. ""It was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier, but would it have made a difference? All the top teams -- Ferrari and ourselves -- were trying to get through the rain and straight onto a dry tire."" Alonso, who qualified for the race in fourth, is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles. ""The result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure,"" he said. ""I think the championship will still be very difficult because I know it will not be easy to take four points from Lewis. ""I need something dramatic if I want to win. With a normal race it will be impossible."" Raikkonen added: ""We are back in the championship and it will be interesting in the final race. ""Hopefully the car is good and it will be a battle all weekend. It is not just up to us though, we saw today that anything can happen, but we are back in the championship.""

It recommended that the Commission take further steps to control the use of hair dye chemicals. (2) The SCCNFP recommended in addition an overall safety assessment strategy for hair dyes including the requirements for testing hair dye cosmetic ingredients for their potential genotoxicity/mutagenicity. (3) Following the opinions of the SCCNFP, the Commission together with Member States and stakeholders agreed on an overall strategy to regulate hair dyes according to which the industry was required to submit the files with scientific data on hair dyes to be evaluated by the SCCNFP. (4) As a first step in the implementation of the strategy it was decided to give priority to permanent hair dye substances for which no explicit interest was expressed during the public consultation in defence of their use in hair dyes. Those substances should therefore be banned. (5) According to the opinion of the SCCNFP, certain azo dyes pose a risk to the health of the consumer. They were therefore deleted from the positive list of colouring agents allowed for use in cosmetic products in Annex IV to Directive 76/768/EEC. For the same reason they should also be banned for use in hair dyes. (6) For hair dye substances provisionally allowed in part 2 of Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC the provisional period should be extended. (7) Annexes II and III to Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly. (8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products, HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Annexes II and III to Directive 76/768/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive. Article 2 Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that from 1 December 2006 at the latest no cosmetic products which fail to comply with this Directive are placed on the market by Community manufacturers or by importers established within the Community, nor sold or disposed of to the final consumer.

"GLASGOW, Scotland -- Scottish Premier League leaders Celtic suffered another setback in their bid for a third successive title after being held 1-1 by managerless Hibernian on Saturday. David Murphy's goals have earned Hibernian four points against the Auld Firm this season. Gordon Strachan's team head the table by three points from Glasgow rivals Rangers, who have three games in hand ahead of Sunday's trip to Aberdeen. Visiting Hibernian, whose manager John Collins surprisingly resigned on Thursday citing a lack of financial backing from the Edinburgh side's board, took the lead in the 20th minute through left-back David Murphy. The Englishman played a one-two with Abdessalam Benjelloun before crashing a shot from the edge of the box past goalkeeper Mark Brown and in off the crossbar. Murphy's only other goal this season came in Hibs' 1-0 win at Rangers on October 6. Brown did well to keep out Merouane Zemmama's audacious shot from just inside the Celtic half soon after, and also tipped over Brian Kerr's looping header three minutes after half-time. Substitute Jiri Jarosik rescued Celtic from a first home SPL defeat this season in the 78th minute after being teed up by Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, who then headed against the post with two minutes to play. Hibernian held on despite having to play the final few minutes with 10 men, after Benjelloun was stretchered off with their three substitutes already used. The victory lifted the visitors up into fifth place, while Celtic have taken just six points from the last five games. Strachan, who confirmed he is hoping to sign Brazilian defender Coelho next month, said: ""We need to cut out the silly mistakes because if you look at some of the goals we have let in away from home this season, they are silly mistakes. ""We could have definitely done something with every one of them. I'm happy with the number of chance we've made in the last few weeks, but unhappy with individual mistakes. ""It's not been great to look at, and we need to cut it out. We have honest lads walking in to the dressing room and saying, 'That was my fault.' ""I said to them, 'It's very commendable lads but we can't keep doing this.' There has been a lot going right for us, but one or two things going wrong. We have to deal with that, and then I will look forward to the rest of the season."" Third-placed Motherwell missed the chance to move above Rangers after being beaten 3-0 at home by Falkirk, who climbed to ninth with two goals in the second half to Michael Higdon and then another from Patrick Clegg on 65 minutes. Fourth-placed Dundee United failed to take advantage, losing 2-1 at home to bottom club Gretna -- whose only two wins this season have come against the Tangerines. Kenny Deuchar put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute before striker Noel Hunt leveled on 29, and Nicky Deverdics scored the eventual winner for the Borders outfit three minutes before half-time. Inverness Caledonian Thistle followed up last weekend's shock 3-2 victory against Celtic by also winning at Hearts by the same scoreline. The visitors led through Russell Duncan after 22 minutes and John Rankin made it 2-0 with a 53rd-minute penalty before Christophe Berra pulled one back on 62 and Lithuanian striker Andrius Velicka leveled from the spot (90). However, Graham Bayne scored a dramatic injury-time winner to lift Caley into the top six. In Saturday's other game, second-bottom St Mirren drew 0-0 at home to fellow strugglers Kilmarnock to be left seven points ahead of Gretna. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- A young girl shown on video being sexually assaulted was raped while in the care of a baby sitter her mother hired, the mother's attorney said Tuesday. Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, of Nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a young girl. The mother did not know her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until last Friday, Jerry T. Donohue said. ""A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,'"" he said. Donohue said the mother recognized the suspect, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a former animal trainer. The abuse most likely occurred while the mother - a single woman working six days a week - was at work, Donohue said. The attorney said he knows who the baby sitter is, but would not release that information because of the ongoing investigation. Earlier, officials had said the girl, who is now 7, was 3-years-old at the time the video was made. But Donohue said Tuesday, ""To my understanding, the abuse occurred before she was 3 years old."" The mother of the girl asked that the news media leave the family alone. ""I want to ask you, the press, to respect my family's privacy and to not attempt to contact my daughter or myself,"" the mother said in a written statement read by her attorney. Watch Donohue read the mother's statement » . The mother also said she is cooperating with investigators and that her daughter ""is safe and healthy."" The girl's videotaped rape set off a nationwide search last week. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas, Nevada, after thousands of tips poured in. Professionals have since evaluated her and she appears to be ""healthy and fine and happy,"" the lawyer said. The lawyer said neither he nor the mother has watched the videotape. Asked whether the mother is thankful to the news media for having published the girl's picture so that authorities were able to identify her, Donohue said, ""Not really ... there's some things maybe you don't want to know."" Still, he said, he hopes the man in the tape is brought to justice. ""Speaking as a father myself, I wish the guy would dig a hole in the desert and put a gun in his mouth,"" he said, referring to such an outcome as ""Wild-West justice."" Meanwhile, the intense manhunt for Stiles continued Tuesday. On Monday, Stiles' former girlfriend, Tina Allen, told CNN she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is ""mortified"" by the allegations against him. Allen said she and Stiles were in an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years until recently, when she called it off. ""He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,"" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, who allegedly was victimized by Stiles. ""I'm disgusted. I'm ashamed, embarrassed, mortified,"" Allen said of the alleged rape. ""I regret every, every step I ever took, I feel bad for the baby."" The FBI is also seeking Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas. A man who said he found the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in Sunday to Nye County officials. Darren Tuck, a Nevada resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography.

Zenit captain Anatoly Timoshuk kisses the Russian Premier League trophy after their victory at Ramenskoye. The win means Zenit finish top of the table with 61 points, two points ahead of second-placed Spartak Moscow, who beat city rivals Dynamo 2-1. CKSA Moscow finished third on 53 points. Zenit went ahead in the 15th minute when Radek Sirl's shot from the edge of the box deflected off a Ramenskoye defender and beat goalkeeper Antonin Kinski.

Nine-times champions Spartak took the lead midway through the first-half. Russian international striker Roman Pavyuchenko netted the opening goal in the 24th minute with a powerful shot from the edge of the six-yard box after a mix- up in the Dynamo defence.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Prince Harry led tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales on the 10th anniversary of her death, describing her as ""the best mother in the world"" in a speech at a memorial service. Here is his speech in full: . William and I can separate life into two parts. There were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father. Princes Harry and William greet guests at a thanksgiving service in memory of their mother. And then there are the 10 years since our mother's death. When she was alive, we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life, laughter, fun and folly. She was our guardian, friend and protector. She never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated. She will always be remembered for her amazing public work. But behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. We would say that, wouldn't we. But we miss her. She kissed us last thing at night. Her beaming smile greeted us from school. She laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day. She encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure. She -- like our father -- was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood. To lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age, as others have experienced, is indescribably shocking and sad. It was an event which changed our lives forever, as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night. But what is far more important to us now, and into the future, is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was: fun-loving, generous, down-to-earth, entirely genuine. We both think of her every day. We speak about her and laugh together at all the memories. Put simply, she made us, and so many other people, happy. May this be the way that she is remembered. Prince William's reading from St Paul's letter to the Ephesians: . I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to the riches of His glory, He may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through His Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to Him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever. Amen. Thanks be to God. The Bishop of London's speech: . ""Who's cheating?"" The scene is an old people's home. Two residents are playing Beggar My Neighbor. Enter the Princess. The question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs. Afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room. One tiny incident, characteristic of countless other occasions in the Princess's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort. Everyone here will have their own memories. I remember meeting Princess Diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in St Paul's. Even Archbishop's Chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and I was nervous entering the presence. It must have been a bewildering time for the Princess as well, but even then, at the age of 20, her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated. Prince Harry has spoken movingly and justly, as few others have the right to do, about the Princess as a mother. I want to dwell for a moment on her public work, its cost and its meaning. After her marriage, the Princess joined her natural gifts of beauty, empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the Royal Family generates. Led by our Queen and other members of the Royal Family, our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century. There is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but doesn't intrude, but there is another sphere, vital to any sense of national unity and creativity, a sphere in which communities must be celebrated, common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored. We tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is God's will, but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in Christ, the human face of God, then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society. And at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric, the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech, and the Princess brought her own gifts to this work. She was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the Middlesex Hospital's Aids ward. It was the first in the UK and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded Aids in the '80s. Those familiar with the field have no doubt that the Princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin. And she had a similar impact in the USA. An editorial in the New York Times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign, and even a royal, dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the US. Her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the Ottawa Convention, banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children. She proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which, of course, have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries. And as she said, in her words, ""the biggest disease today is not leprosy or TB but the feeling of being unwanted"". She sought out places of suffering, because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed, and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way. Bill Deedes accompanied her on some of her visits. His response to the cynics was typically robust. He said: ""She was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well. She was good at this because she herself was vulnerable. She knew the feeling. She didn't set out to be a saint."" The role brought great power but, like any member of the Royal Family, she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny. Honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task. As we have heard from Prince Harry, his mother Diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead. She confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched. She said of John, a young Greek suffering from cystic fibrosis: ""He showed no sign of anger, no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that I have never before encountered."" The love of Christ described in the lesson read by Prince William contains the essence of the spiritual life. Princess Diana recognized this quality of life in many of those, like John, whose lives she touched. It was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out. And the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself, the more you will become your true self; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others, the more you will find yourself; the more you keep company with those who suffer, the more you will be healed. This is the knowledge which passes all understanding. This is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints. It's easy to lose the real person in the image, to insist that all is darkness or all is light. Still, 10 years after her tragic death, there are regular reports of ""fury"" at this or that incident, and the Princess's memory is used for scoring points. Let it end here. Let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion. Let us also, echoing the words of Prince Harry, look to the future and pray, in the words of St Paul, for all those who serve our country as members of the Royal Family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her: . ""I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of Christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of God.""

"Council Decision of 26 April 2004 granting Cyprus, Malta and Poland certain temporary derogations from Directive 2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment (2004/486/EC) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty concerning the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic to the European Union, and in particular Article 2(3) thereof, Having regard to the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union is founded, hereinafter ""2003 Act of Accession"", and in particular Article 55 thereof, Having regard to the requests of Cyprus, Malta and Poland, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Whereas: (1) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 5(5) of Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)(1), Member States are to ensure that by 31 December 2006 at the latest a rate of separate collection of at least four kilograms on average per inhabitant per year of waste electrical and electronic equipment from private households is achieved. (2) Article 7(2) of Directive 2002/96/EC lays down certain minimum targets for the recovery of waste electrical and electronic equipment and for component, material and substance reuse and recycling. The Member States have to ensure that producers meet these targets by 31 December 2006. (3) In accordance with Article 17(1) of Directive 2002/96/EC, Member States are to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with that Directive by 13 August 2004. However, Article 17(4)(a) of Directive 2002/96/EC provides that Greece and Ireland which, because of their overall recycling infrastructure deficit, geographical circumstances such as the large number of small islands and the presence of rural and mountain areas, low population density, and low level of consumption of electrical and electronic equipment are unable to reach either the collection target mentioned in the first subparagraph of Article 5(5) or the recovery targets mentioned in Article 7(2) of Directive 2002/96/EC and which, under the third subparagraph of Article 5(2) of Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste(2), may apply for an extension of the deadline mentioned in that Article, may extend the periods referred to in Articles 5(5) and 7(2) of Directive 2002/96/EC by up to 24 months. (4) On the basis of Article 55 of the 2003 Act of Accession, Cyprus, Malta and Poland requested transitional periods by way of temporary derogation from the time-limits laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 5(5) and Article 7(2) of Directive 2002/96/EC. Malta stated as reasons its recycling infrastructure deficit, low quantities of waste electrical and electronic equipment, constraints due to the fact that it is a small and geographically isolated country with a small local market and a high population density with attendant land-use problems, and that it is a net importer of electrical and electronic equipment. Cyprus and Poland stated as reasons their recycling infrastructure deficit and low population density. Poland also cited its high proportion of rural areas. (5) Those reasons justify an extension of the abovementioned time-limits for Cyprus, Malta and Poland by 24 months, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Cyprus, Malta and Poland may extend the time-limits referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 5(5) and Article 7(2) of Directive 2002/96/EC by 24 months.

"LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. ""I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,"" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. ""I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. ""The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs."" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film ""Hostel: Part II,"" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. ""I'll definitely have some sort of party,"" he said in an interview. ""Hopefully none of you will be reading about it."" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. ""People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'"" he told reporters last month. ""But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.""

"The Briton, 23, had two set points on his own serve to force a decider but could not convert, and Robredo won the third-round match 7-6 (8-6) 6-1 4-6 7-5 in three hours and 13 minutes. Robredo, who struggled with a leg injury in the closing stages, fought back superbly from 5-3 down in the fourth set to claim victory. Evans, ranked 179th, earned £60,000 in prize money for his efforts and enough points to get close to the world's top 150, but missed out on a possible dream fourth-round match against Roger Federer. ""It was a tough one, especially to go down in the fourth set after serving for it and having two set points,"" Evans told BBC Radio 5 live. ""I felt in pretty much total control of the match. The last point is always the hardest one and I couldn't get that last point of the set to take it to a fifth. ""I just played two really loose points - that's all it was. They came at the wrong time. I just have to learn on that for next time."" It was the British number three's sixth match in 10 days at Flushing Meadows after coming through three rounds of qualifying, then beating 11th seed Kei Nishikori and world number 52 Bernard Tomic. He had never won a match in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament before New York, and playing under lights on the Louis Armstrong Stadium, albeit in front of a sparse crowd, was a far cry from the Challenger events he is more used to. Evans impressed in the opening set but 31-year-old Robredo's experience told as he edged it in the tie-break, then raced through the second in just 28 minutes. Defeat was not far away for Evans at 4-4 in the third but he got the vital break with a sharp backhand volley, pumping his fist as he made his way back to the chair, and served out the set to love with an ace. ""I was sure the match was heading to a fifth set but Dan Evans just tightened up. After missing those set points in the fourth, he started rushing a bit, showed his inexperience and made a couple of bad shot choices. ""It is such a shame for him, but once he gets over the disappointment there is no doubt that there are so many positives. It looks like his career is going to go to another level after this tournament."" Things seemed to be turning Evans's way when Robredo spent the next two changeovers having his left thigh massaged, but the Spaniard fought magnificently in the fourth set. Evans was bristling with positive intent, moving forward at every opportunity, and twice broke to go ahead, but, serving at 5-3, 40-15, the nerves appeared to bite and he gave the set points up with a double fault and an error. Robredo sensed his chance and pounded away from the baseline, drawing two more errors to recover the game and, after a solid hold, the pressure was quickly back on Evans. From standing on the verge of a fifth set, Evans was now serving to stay in the match, and a wayward drop shot and a double fault brought Robredo to match point. He closed in on the net to chase down another drop shot and leapt upon the Briton's response to angle away the volley and bring Evans's amazing US Open campaign to a sudden end. ""It's been a great experience, a great learning curve,"" added Evans, who heads to Croatia next for Great Britain's Davis Cup tie on 13-15 September. ""I can definitely play with these guys so I should be confident going into the next tournaments.""",formal
"Mr Mosley wants Google to block photos of him at a sex party first printed in the now-defunct News of the World, which he successfully sued in 2008. He is suing the internet firm for breaches of the Data Protection Act and misusing private information. Google's barrister argued that Mr Mosley no longer has a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"". Mr Mosley won damages from the News of the World after it published a story alleging he had organised a Nazi-themed orgy. Photographs and a video which show his private sexual activity were originally obtained by News Group Newspapers Limited (NGN) in a clandestine ""sting"" operation. Mr Mosley - the son of 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - won Â£60,000 after a judge ruled there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme to the sex party and found that his privacy had been breached. In that ruling, the High Court also said the article was not in the public interest. Mr Mosley has said the role-play at a rented Chelsea basement flat was harmless, consensual and private. On launching his legal action last year, Mr Mosley urged: ""Google should operate within the law rather than according to rules it makes itself. It cannot be allowed to ignore judgements in our courts."" Google has said it will remove URLs that it is alerted to, but is not prepared to remove the images entirely from its search engines. In court on Wednesday, Google's barrister Antony White QC for Google conceded that it was technically possible to remove the images and was ""not burdensome"" to do so. However, he argued that Google was not the publisher of the private information, and that Mr Mosley no longer had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images. On that basis, Google will seek to show that Mr Mosley's claim is unfounded. The hearing is due to conclude on Thursday.",formal

"If he does become the next Premier League manager to lose his job, it would not just be unfair, it would be absolutely ridiculous. I cleaned Tim's boots when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995. Of course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material. When I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same. Character is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them. At 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions. We had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry. They were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain. For Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too. He always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game. He comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did. So it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him. At times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it. These days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up. Tim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record. Villa have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different. But, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure. You have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made. Villa's net spend over the summer was under £10m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience. They have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem. I don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process. You cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day. I get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now. Sherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got. The choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is. Like Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League. In an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders. But what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker. Sherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat. Whoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own. Because he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder. Grealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball. However good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way. When you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again. You really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table. That might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter. After trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games. A settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right. Chris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",formal

"JACKSONVILLE, Florida (CNN) -- Eduardo Gonzalez, a petty officer second class with the U.S. Navy, is about to be deployed overseas for a third time. Making his deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back. Mildred and Eduardo Gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported. His wife faces deportation to Guatemala -- her home country that she hasn't seen since 1989. He also doesn't know what would happen to his young son, Eduardo Jr., if that happens. ""I like being in uniform and serving my country, but if she goes back I'm going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job,"" he said. ""Defending the country that's trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind."" Gonzalez, who works on helicopters that bring cargo, supplies and military personnel in and out of Iraq, testified before a House Judiciary Committee panel last month, detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his, where military members' families could be deported while they're defending their country overseas. Watch ""they're tearing families apart"" » . ""I want to serve my country 100 percent. But with this issue in the back of my mind, I feel I can't do that,"" he testified on September 6. The U.S. military does not have a policy to deal with such cases. Each is handled case-by-case, not by the military, but by immigration authorities. The government doesn't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar to Gonzalez's. Immigration officials also said marrying a U.S. citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to U.S. citizenship or permanent legal status. Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, a member of the U.S. Army Reserves who teaches immigration law at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members. ""You got to understand. When you're in a combat zone, you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy. You can't be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where you're never going to see them again,"" she said. Stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases. On the one hand, the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance, housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas. On the other hand, the same government is trying to deport the very same people. ""What's happening right now is, because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws, we've got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home,"" she said. In Gonzalez's case, his wife, Mildred, came to the United States with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old. They were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from Guatemala. In September 2000, Mildred's mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application. Her mother was granted legal status in July 2004, according to Gonzalez. However, six weeks earlier, Gonzalez and Mildred got married, canceling Mildred's ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21. As a result, her legal status still remains in jeopardy. A judge in June granted her a one-year extension to remain in the United States. If her legal status does not change by June 8, 2008, she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation. That's just fine, according to Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration. ""What you're talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces, and that's just outrageous,"" he said. ""What we're talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military. ... There's no justification for that kind of policy."" Gonzalez said that type of response is unjustified. ""I'm trying to make his country better -- my country better -- and it should be her country too."" Gonzalez himself entered the country legally, crossing the Mexican border with his family when he was about 10. He joined the Navy as a so-called ""green-card sailor"" and became a U.S. citizen in July 2005. The military does accept some immigrants who aren't U.S. citizens. ""I understand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained, but on the other token, there are times when the situation is just out of their reach,"" Gonzalez said. His wife, Mildred, added, ""We didn't come here to break the law. We just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else."" U.S. Army Sgt. Emmanuel Woko, a member of the Army's 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division who faces his third tour in Iraq, understands just how Gonzalez and his family feel. His wife and children could be sent back to Nigeria. ""My heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to Nigeria while I am deployed in Iraq,"" he said. ""I am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought."" That's a sentiment echoed by Gonzalez: ""We are not asking for anything. We are just asking for our families to stay with us.""

"His departure was said to be one recommendation of a report by former US Attorney-General Eric Holder about the company's culture and practices. Uber said the board had voted unanimously to adopt all the report's recommendations. However, its contents will not be released until Tuesday. Mr Holder was asked to undertake the review in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler made claims of sexual harassment. The Financial Times reported that neither Uber nor Mr Michael would comment on whether he had resigned or been fired. James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt, said Mr Michael's departure reflected Uber's need for a ""fall guy"" and could help protect Mr Kalanick. ""If Kalanick did leave, we think it would be very difficult for him to come back,"" Mr Cakmak told Bloomberg. It is possible Mr Kalanick could be forced to take a leave of absence or have his role altered. That issue was on the agenda at a seven-hour board meeting held in Los Angeles on Sunday. Mr Kalanick has been on bereavement leave following the death of his mother in a boating accident. An Uber insider said the recommendations in Mr Holder's report include introducing more control on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Mr Kalanick have had an unusual degree of autonomy for a company of Uber's size. The San Francisco-based ride-hailing service has more than 12,000 employees. Mr Kalanick has earned a reputation as an abrasive leader and was criticised earlier this year after being caught on video berating an Uber driver. He said in response to the video: ""I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up."" Uber board member Arianna Huffington has said Mr Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a ""scrappy entrepreneur"" to be more like a ""leader of a major global company"". One Uber investor said the board's decisions were a step in the right direction, giving the firm an ""opportunity to reboot"". Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, said: ""This week we finally learn just how committed Travis Kalanick and the rest of the senior leadership team at Uber is to meaningful cultural change."" Last week Uber said it fired 20 staff after another law firm examined more than 200 cases including complaints about sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying. As part of its attempt to draw a line under its recent problems, Uber said it had appointed Wan Ling Martello, a Nestle executive and Alibaba board member, as an independent director. She is the third high-profile female appointment to the company in the past week. Uber, which is still privately owned with voting control resting with Mr Kalanick and his two board allies, is valued at about $68bn. Although revenues hit $6.5bn last year, it is yet to make a profit.",formal

As a result he is normally very calm and well worded, and when he wants to be aggressive goes for the approach of being firm and accurate in his negotiations and basically knowledge bombing people till they don't know what to do.

He also tried to stop me coming into his house or seeing his daughter because of this, no idea how that logic worked seeing as though I was the only person comforting her. So when I arrived at the house he started yelling at me, calling me a drug addict because he knew I have smoked weed before, yelling at me and my girlfriend, she starts yelling back and holding in tears while I patiently waited for him to finish his shit storm idiot rant. Once finished I asked him if we were going to go inside and talk like adults about it or if he wanted to keep throwing a tantrum. He was so taken aback he told us to come in and we sat down.

He continuously tried to interrupt me switching to his daughter, at which every time I calmly stated that I thought we were having an adult conversation and that I would be able to finish my story without being interrupted. By the end of my 5 minutes of knowledge bombing him he couldn't even look me in the eyes, he just said it was fine if I stayed there and I dealt with the situation in a respectful way. I told my dad the story and he just said with a ridiculous grin on his face - ""you are definitely my son."" TL:DR; talked a bully (my girlfriends dad) into thanking me. I am my fathers son",informal

"AMMAN, Jordan (CNN) -- In the sunbathed schoolyard of the Shmisani Institute for Girls in Amman, Jordan, principal Sanaa Abu Harb makes an announcement over the speaker system. Iraqi students at the Shmisani school in Amman gather around a teacher. One in 5 students there is Iraqi. ""All Iraqi girls come outside now. All Iraqi girls. Iraqi girls only!"" she repeats several times, making sure the message is clear and waving away Jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion. Dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground. Harb wants the CNN crew to see how many Iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating. This school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list. Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home » . The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools. Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. ""We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our students,"" she says. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. Seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement. Eighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. Matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare, he repeats the number: ""Five members."" Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation, but also their entry into the workforce. All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones. ""It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know,"" says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. ""I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them."" He pauses: ""But you have to miss your country."" The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age Iraqi children are in Jordan. Many of them are enrolled in private institutions. But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms. As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records. Regardless of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. ""Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education,"" says Touqan, the education minister. ""We will not run a parallel system of education.""

"COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1095/2007 of 20 September 2007 amending Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (Text with EEA relevance) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 8(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that the Commission undertakes a programme of work for the gradual examination of active substances on the market two years after the date of notification of this Directive. This programme is still ongoing. (2) The second and third stage of work are laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000 of 28 February 2000 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the work programme referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) and Commission Regulation 1490/2002 of 14 August 2002 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC and amending Regulation (EC) No 451/2000 (3). The fourth stage of work is laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 of 3 December 2004 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (4). (3) Several substances in the third and fourth stages are still in the assessment phase. It appears necessary to speed up the examination process. Depending on whether a substance is already under peer review or not, for certain aspects of the procedure, different provisions should apply. (4) To speed up the examination process the workflow of the peer review and relationship between notifiers, Member States, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Commission and the obligations of each of the parties for the implementation of the programme should be adapted without harming the level of safety for health and the environment. (5) The resources of the EFSA should be used efficiently. Where there are clear indications that the active substance concerned meets the criteria referred to in Article 5(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC, and in particular does not have any harmful effects on humans or animal health or on groundwater or any unacceptable influence on the environment, that substance should be included in Annex I to that Directive. Such clear cases would not require detailed scientific advice from the EFSA before the substance is included in Annex I. The EFSA should, however, deliver its view on those substances later, in particular to ensure a harmonised approach when Member States apply the uniform principles at the evaluation of authorisations. Where, on the contrary, there are clear indications that an active substance has harmful affects; the Commission is not required to have this clear situation confirmed, so it should have the possibility to decide on non-inclusion without consulting the EFSA. (6) The EFSA should focus on cases where the remaining doubts need to be resolved before a decision on the inclusion of the active substance concerned can be taken. (7) To further speed up procedures, it should be possible to grant a longer withdrawal period in cases where there are such remaining doubts and notifiers agree to withdraw their support of the inclusion of the active substance. This procedure should only apply to cases where there are no clear indications that the substance has harmful effects on humans or animal health or on groundwater or any unacceptable influence on the environment. (8) To identify cases where there are clear indications of either a substance having no harmful effects or, on the contrary, a substance having such effects, criteria should be set out. (9) In order to ensure that the deadlines for evaluation are met, and to ensure equal treatment of all notifiers, the current legislation provides that notifiers may not submit new studies after a certain stage of the assessment, subject to limited exceptions. This general principle should be retained, but it is appropriate to clarify when notifiers may submit new information other than studies. (10) Regulations (EC) No 1490/2002 and (EC) No 2229/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly. (11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 is amended as follows: 1.

"(CNN) -- The crew members of a North Korean freighter regained control of their ship from pirates who hijacked the vessel off Somalia, but not without a deadly fight, the U.S. Navy reported Tuesday. The USS James E. Williams ordered pirates to give up their weapons, the Navy says. When the battle aboard the Dai Hong Dan was over, two pirates were dead and five were captured, the Navy said. Three wounded crew members from the cargo ship were being treated aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS James E. Williams. The captured pirates were being held aboard the North Korean vessel, the Navy said. The bandits had seized the ship's bridge, while the crew kept control of the steering gear and engines, the Navy said. The Koreans moved against the attackers after the Williams -- responding to reports of the hijacking -- ordered the pirates to give up their weapons, according to the Navy. When the crew members stormed the bridge, the deadly battle began. After the crew regained control, Navy sailors boarded the Dai Hong Dan to help with the injured. North Korea and the United States have no diplomatic relations. Watch why the U.S. helped the North Koreans » . The incident took place about 70 miles northeast of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, the Navy said. It is the second incident of piracy reported in recent days. A second U.S. Navy destroyer was searching waters off Somalia for pirates who hijacked a Japanese-owned ship, military officials said. Over the weekend, gunmen aboard two skiffs hijacked the Panamanian-flagged Golden Nori off the Socotra archipelago near the Horn of Africa, said Andrew Mwangura, a spokesman for the Kenyan-based Seafarers' Assistance Program. The guided-missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke has been pursuing the pirates after entering Somali waters with the permission of the troubled transitional government in Mogadishu, U.S. officials said Monday. In recent years, warships have stayed outside the 12-mile limit when chasing pirates. Two military officials familiar with the details confirmed the ongoing operation. The Navy's pursuit of the pirates began Sunday night when the Golden Nori radioed for help. The Burke's sister ship, the USS Porter, opened fire and sank the pirate skiffs tied to the Golden Nori's stern before the Burke took over shadowing the hijacked vessel. When the shots were fired, it was not known the ship was filled with highly flammable benzene. U.S. military officials indicate there is a great deal of concern about the cargo because it is so sensitive. Benzene, which U.S. authorities have declared a known human carcinogen, is used as a solvent and to make plastics and synthetic fabrics. Four other ships in the region remain in pirate hands, the Navy said. U.S. and NATO warships have been patrolling off the Horn of Africa for years in an effort to crack down on piracy off Somalia, where a U.N.-backed transitional government is struggling to restore order after 15 years of near-anarchy. See how piracy is worse than 2006 » . On Monday, the head of the transitional government resigned as his administration -- backed by Ethiopian troops -- battled insurgents from the Islamic movement that seized control of Mogadishu in 2006. Hospital officials reported 30 dead in three days of clashes on the city's south side. In June, the ship USS Carter Hall fired warning shots in an attempt to stop a hijacked Danish cargo ship off Somalia, but the American vessel turned away when the pirated ship entered Somali waters. In May, a U.S. Navy advisory warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast. But the U.S. Maritime Administration said pirates sometimes issue false distress calls to lure ships closer to shore. See the warning area » . The pirates often are armed with automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rockets, according to a recent warning from the agency. ""To date, vessels that increase speed and take evasive maneuvers avoid boarding, while those that slow down are boarded, taken to the Somali coastline and released after successful ransom payment, often after protracted negotiations of as much as 11 weeks,"" the warning advised. The agency issued a new warning to sailors in the Gulf of Aden, between Somalia and Yemen, after Sunday's hijacking. E-mail to a friend .

"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars. Sebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen. The world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole. But stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said ""no clear instruction was given on where he should park"". Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut. Vandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer ""did a good job and I didn't"". Mercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying. After the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap. But Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session. Vettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done. The gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them. Vettel said: ""Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time."" Vandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago. The Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday. He also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak. Button was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered. The 24-year-old said: ""I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened. ""Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying."" Button, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: ""Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was."" The controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system. FIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he ""felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance"", adding: ""We live in a world where there is too much over reaction."" The system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out. But it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib. Only one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake. The teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season. Todt said he was ""optimistic"" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change. ""We should listen to the people watching on TV,"" Rosberg said. ""If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it."" Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg. Ricciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest. German Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car. Bahrain GP qualifying results Bahrain GP coverage details",formal

“ My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.”\n-Elizabeth Bennett (Pride and Prejudice)\n#Quotes #Courage #FaceYourFears,informal
"(CNN) -- It was two years late and billions of dollars over budget, but this week the Singapore Airline-owned A380 completed its maiden passenger journey between Singapore and Sydney. Making history: the first double bed on a commercial jet . On board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience. This was a turning point in aviation history as Airbus' superjumbo became the world's largest aircraft. And the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration. Singapore Airlines' CEO, Chew Choon Seng named the jetliner the ""queen of the skies"". Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds. And CNN's Richard Quest, who was on board the maiden flight, said there was ""nothing quite like it"". The luxury on board, he said, sets a new standard for air travel. It's the quietest large passenger jet ever built (inside and out), it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions, it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort. But the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the Singapore Airlines A380 is its ''beyond first class"" cabins. Behind the sliding doors of the Singapore Airlines Suites, the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading French yacht designer, Jean-Jacques Coste. There's a wide leather seat and alongside that, a standalone bed. This is two meters long with Givenchy duvets and cushions. And for couples traveling, the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds. From bed or chair, travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen LCD. Laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a USB ports and access a suite of office tools on Singapore Airlines' in-flight entertainment system. Celebrity chefs including Britain's Gordon Ramsay and Georges Blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off Givenchy tableware. Unlike other airlines, that have considered offering casinos, gyms and showers on their future A380s, Singapore Airlines has opted instead for a configuration that, whilst offering luxury, also makes money. As Chew Choon Seng, CEO of Singapore Airlines reminded reporters last week, the first Boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash. Behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats, ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks, as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide. Singapore Airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $5.7 billion. The second is due to arrive next February with further deliveries later in 2008. Tickets for the A380's first return commercial flight between Singapore and Sydney were sold at auction on eBay. One passenger paid $100,000 for the experience, with the majority paying between $1,500 and $5,000. The $1.4 million raised has gone to charities in Singapore, Sydney and a global humanitarian organization. From Sunday 28 October, Singapore Airlines will commence its scheduled service between Singapore and Sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction. The jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between Singapore and London's Heathrow Airport. It's been a long road to this point for Airbus, but the journey is by no means over. The airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers (see figures below). Next year it plans to deliver 13, a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010. Tom Enders, Airbus' CEO doesn't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead. ""This is not a piece of cake,"" he told CNN, ""but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers."" It hasn't just been Airbus that has been frantically preparing for the A380 launch. Airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates, as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks. Seventy airports are now ready, Airbus has said. Singapore's Changi Airport, home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, was the first, and when its new Terminal 3 opens early next year, 19 gates across the three terminals will be A380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks. Heathrow's new Terminal 5 will be able to handle four A380s at one time. British Airways, the Terminal's sole occupant, recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants BAA to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to Terminal 5 to accommodate them. As Willie Walsh, BA's CEO told CNN, ""we want to make sure that development is built with the A380 in mind."" But whether the arrival of the A380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided. As CNN's Richard Quest points out, while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly, demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as Boeing's up-coming 787 Dreamliner. As Richard Quest says, ""there's no doubt the A380 will sell, but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount Airbus needs to make money."" But those worries, he adds, are for another day. Thursday was a day for celebration. SOME KEY FIGURES . Orders . Total: 185 orders (165 firm orders) 15 customers .

"(CNN) -- At least 14 people were killed and 60 others wounded Thursday when a bomb ripped through a crowd waiting to see Algeria's president in Batna, east of the capital of Algiers, the Algerie Presse Service reported. A wounded person gets first aid shortly after Thursday's attack in Batna, Algeria. The explosion occurred at 5 p.m. about 20 meters (65 feet) from a mosque in Batna, a town about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Algiers, security officials in Batna told the state-run news agency. The bomb went off 15 minutes before the expected arrival of President Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika. It wasn't clear if the bomb was caused by a suicide bomber or if it was planted, the officials said. Later Thursday, Algeria's Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni said ""a suspect person who was among the crowd attempted to go beyond the security cordon,"" but the person escaped ""immediately after the bomb exploded,"" the press service reported. Bouteflika made his visit to Batna as planned, adding a stop at a hospital to visit the wounded before he returned to the capital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. Algeria faces a continuing Islamic insurgency, according to the CIA. In July, 33 people were killed in apparent suicide bombings in Algiers that were claimed by an al Qaeda-affiliated group. Bouteflika said terrorist acts have nothing in common with the noble values of Islam, the press service reported. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.",formal

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation. Raymond Soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will. One of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Haldol, which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered. Two immigrants, Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa, told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will. Both are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government. They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages. Watch why the former detainees claim abuse » . Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at Columbia University, reviewed both men's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered. ""I'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way,"" said Appelbaum, who also serves as a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law. ""That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world."" The allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers. ""The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards,"" Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail. ""Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so."" ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham, who is representing Soeoth and Diouf, said, ""It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who isn't even mentally ill. ... But here, it's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport."" Responding to Lieberman's written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had ""medical escorts"" for deportation since 2003. From October last year to the end of April this year, she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process. Of those, 33 detainees received medication ""because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self,"" she said. ""First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards,"" Myers said. She added no detainee should be ""involuntarily medicated without court order,"" except in emergency situations. But both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior. Soeoth, a Christian minister from Indonesia, spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected. Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7, 2004, he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days. See the document that shows Soeoth was injected . ""They pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection,"" he said through broken English. He says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor, but two hours before takeoff, airline security refused to transport him, so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. Terminal Island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation. Soeoth's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol, even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness. In the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making. ICE said in a written statement it couldn't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation. ""Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees,"" the ICE statement said. ""Only trained and qualified medical professionals, including officers of the U.S. Public Health Service, may prescribe or administer medication."" But, Diouf says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported. He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts wouldn't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country. See Diouf's stay of deportation document . That's when, he says, ""I was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes."" A government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders. In both cases, Diouf and Soeoth remain in the United States pending a decision in the case. If they lose, they may land back in the hands of ICE, once again facing deportation. Soeoth says he's traumatized by what happened. ""I know this country [is] very generous to immigrants,"" he says.

"The show could be dramatically improved, and this is a flaw of both RTD and Moffar, by doing one simple thing. LET PEOPLE STAY DEAD.

I don't watch the Doctor to see what magic he is going to pull out of his ass this week but I do watch it to see this impossible man face impossible odds and how he fights them, sometimes his luck simply has to run out.

"While I was under during my spinal surgery a few years back I had the most vivid and terrifying dream of my life. My eyes slowly opened as I tried to shake off the grogginess of sleep. Immediately, I was filled with a sense of dread and discomfort, and my surveillance of my surroundings did little to comfort me. I was naked, laying on a large operating table made entirely of cold stainless steel. The room I found myself in was completely empty, save for my metal platform, with the wall that my feet were towards being made of glass. On the other side of the glass was my mother, talking nervously with some doctors and looking more and more hysterical as they attempted to comfort her. My voice caught in my throat as I tried to call out, and my legs refused to budge as if welded to the steel. At this moment, I noticed the single most excruciating pain I've felt in my life, and collapsed back onto the table. I looked down at my chest, and saw a gaping, gory, bleeding chasm stretching from my collar bone down to my belly button. I could feel my stomach turn, for as I looked closer, the inside of my chest was hollowed, as if I'd been cleaned like some game. With uneasy trepidation, I plunged my right hand down, further and further into my chest, looking desperately for any organs that would remain. For how could I live without them? My hand returned, sheathed in a thick coating of blood, at which point I lost the ability to breathe. A cold wind swept over my body as I curled up, a pool of blood now leaking from the massive hole in my chest that I knew I couldn't fix. I would die here. Cold, alone, sad, and afraid. Though the dream lasted little more than two minutes, I can recall every second with complete and total detail.

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Wednesday he is cutting all ties with Colombia as long as Alvaro Uribe remains its president. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe withdrew his support for the Venezuelan leader's mediation efforts with the FARC. ""I say before the world, while President Uribe is president of Colombia, I will not have any type of relation with him or with the government of Colombia,"" Chavez said in an address broadcast on national television. ""I can't, I can't, I can't."" Chavez noted that Uribe had asked him to help secure the release of hundreds of hostages being held by the leftist rebel group Armed Revolutionary Front of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). ""I went with my heart in my hand, and I was ready,"" Chavez told a group of supporters in the southwestern state of Tachira. ""I was prepared to go to the most dangerous forest in the country to help."" But last Thursday, Uribe ended Chavez's participation, citing his direct communication with Uribe's top general, a move that Uribe said broke protocol. ""When we were at the point of succeeding, Uribe comes and, without telling me anything, he didn't even call me on the phone or send me an emissary, just sent me a letter saying he was ending my mission,"" Chavez said. ""That was a kick."" Without being specific, Chavez accused Uribe of having lied. ""That's real ugly,"" he said.

"LONDON, England -- UEFA has punished Benfica midfielder Augustin Binya with a six-match European ban following his horror tackle on Celtic's Scott Brown last week. Augustin Binya, right, lunges towards Celtic midfielder Scott Brown during Benfica's 1-0 defeat in Glasgow. The Cameroon international was sent off for the challenge in his side's 1-0 defeat in the Champions League match in Glasgow last Wednesday. Scotland international Brown avoided injury, but claimed Binya had tried to break his leg with the tackle in the 85th minute -- and demanded that Europe's governing body take further action. Binya, 24, apologized for the challenge -- described by officiating referee Martin Hansson of Sweden as one of the worst he had ever seen -- on the day after the match. But UEFA's control and disciplinary body announced their sanction on Friday morning, having deliberated on the case on Thursday. In a statement on uefa.com, Binya's challenge was described as one which ""seriously endangered the physical health of the opposing player"". Benfica can appeal against the ban, which rules Binya out of the Portuguese club's remaining Group D matches against AC Milan and Shakhtar Donetsk. If unsuccessful, he will also miss any matches in the knockout stages of the Champions League or UEFA Cup. The suspension will also carry over to future seasons if, as seems likely, Benfica finish bottom of Group D and bow out of Europe for this campaign. Brown, who has been passed fit for Scotland's Euro 2008 qualifier against Italy, said straight after the Benfica match: ""He obviously tried to do me as hard as possible."" It is the second time that UEFA has had to intervene following an incident involving Celtic this season. AC Milan keeper Dida was handed a two-match ban, subsequently reduced to one on appeal, after collapsing theatrically when a fan of the Scottish club invaded the pitch and lightly slapped the Brazilian in the face.

"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the ""forgotten floor,"" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the ""forgotten floor."" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually ""avoidable felonies."" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor. Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. ""I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!"" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered ""lunatics"" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the ""forgotten floor"" will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"And yet that anonymity isn't always enough for people to say, out loud, that they are atheists. If it was a phone survey, they have your phone number. And if they have your phone number...well, put it together yourself. When there are fundamentalists out there that believe atheists should be registered like sex offenders, a lie can many times allay the fears of being ""found out"" and ostracized or confronted or discriminated against. Also, while I sort of understand your Buddhist conversions argument, another problem with the survey is that it's not asking about beliefs, but about religions. People have a desire to be a part of something bigger than the individual and will reach out to religion many times to fill that void. It doesn't mean that atheists suddenly believe in a god, it means they want something more than what they have had. Sometimes it's pantheism, paganism, deism, atheistic Buddhism, etc. I once embraced Buddhism as a ""way of life"" and rejected the notion that it was a religion. During that time, I still believed in a higher power and eventually went back to Christianity before shedding all supernatural beliefs and openly stating my atheism (to myself and close friends only due to fear of rejection from my family). If I went back to Buddhism now, as an atheist, I still wouldn't believe in a god or higher power and yet may chose to label myself as a Buddhist. That doesn't mean that I'm not also an atheist. And **this** is why the survey is flawed. It simply asks what were you raised and what do you consider yourself now and if there is a change, it's set as a hit against the initial group. Where's Universal Unitarian? Pagan? Secular humanism? Any other association with belief and not religion? Remember, people like labels. It helps them file things away in their mind and shorten the amount of time necessary to form opinions.

"Neill Birnie is paralysed from the neck down as a result of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. In 2014, he was admitted to Antrim Area Hospital three times. He said that following the first admission he discovered a DNR order had been placed on his medical file. According to Mr Birnie, the order had been placed on his record without his knowledge. The 48-year-old is unable to talk and spoke to me via a head-operated computer. ""A consultant told me that I had gone through enough and I had to face the facts. ""He went on to say that he'd consulted with others and that they both thought that a DNR notice should be placed on my admission file,"" said Mr Birnie. He told the BBC that at no time did either he or his sister grant permission for a DNR notice to be placed on his file. While he survived the first bout of pneumonia, he said he discovered when admitted for a second time that the DNR notice had not been removed. ""What some of the doctors did was life-threatening and mentally cruel. I felt I had been tossed to the one side, I had no feelings of self worth,"" added Mr Birnie. Several months after the incident, Mr Birnie made an official complaint to the Northern Health and Social Care Trust. In a letter to Mr Birnie dated October 2015 and seen by the BBC, the trust explained that as he was so unwell they had spoken to his sister. The trust also said that if the infection had caused his heart to stop, medical staff would not have been able to bring him back and that attempts at cardio respiratory resuscitation would not have been in his best interests. However, Mr Birnie said he does not accept that a DNR notice was placed on his file in advance of him being admitted without his or his sister's consent. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the Northern Health Trust confirmed that a DNR notice was placed on Mr Birnie's file in January 2014, but not before a conversation had taken place with their patient. ""The decision to implement a DNR is a medical one, which is taken in cases where medical professionals feel that if a person's medical condition at that time causes their heart to stop, resuscitation attempts would be futile and therefore not in their best interests in providing a dignified death. ""This was discussed with Mr Birnie initially and was put in place following a conversation with his next of kin who indicated that they had talked it over with Mr Birnie and agreed with the decision taken,"" the statement said. ""A DNR notice is reviewed and, if felt appropriate, renewed on a daily basis. There is currently no DNR on Mr Birnie's file and his treatment remains unaffected."" A DNR notice is an extremely sensitive issue. Often the subject can arise when a person least expects it or is not in a position to make a rational judgement. The order means medical staff will not attempt to bring the patient back to life if they stop breathing or their heart stops. The decision to use one is ultimately a doctor's, but official guidelines from the British Medical Association (BMA) state medical staff have a duty to discuss it with relatives wherever possible. The problem for medical staff is that sometimes the conversation between doctor and the patient or family may not take place in time. The usual circumstances in which it is appropriate not to resuscitate are when it will not restart the heart or breathing; when there is no benefit to the patient; and when the benefits are outweighed by the burdens. The guidelines also say that it should only be issued after discussions with the patient or family. However, according to Neill Birnie that did not happen. As a quadriplegic who requires 24-hour care via the computer, he told me he is still a human being with feelings: ""The lights are still on and I am definitely at home."" Via his voice-activated computer, he told a rude joke that made me laugh. He smiled through his eyes. At times, there were tears in his eyes. Earlier this year, a study by the Royal College of Physicians in England found one in five families was not consulted when doctors had decided not to revive their relative.

Long lines formed before counters opened at the Northern Rock building society, one of the UK's top five lenders, as worried customers ignored reassurances from the bank and the government.

"HELSINKI, Finland (CNN) -- An 18-year-old authorities say shot eight people inside his high school in southern Finland, before turning the gun on himself, has died, police said. An image from a video posted on YouTube by ""Sturmgeist89."" The shooting appeared to have been planned out in graphic videos posted on Internet file-sharing site YouTube. At a news conference this afternoon, police confirmed the dead numbered two girls, five boys and the school's headmistress at Jokela High in Tuusula, a quiet town around 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Helsinki. Ten other people were taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The shooter, whom police identified as Pekka Eric Auvinen, died at Toolo Hospital, authorities said. Police said he took his own life. It was the first school shooting in Finland since 1989, when a 14-year-old student shot and killed two others in the coastal town of Rauma, the Finnish news agency STT reported. Police said Auvinen is from Tuusula and who acted alone. He had no previous criminal record and had never threatened anyone from the school before, they added. Auvinen published a manifesto online demanding war on the ""weak-minded masses"" and pledged to die for his cause. Watch Auvinen fire weapons in video from his Web page » . YouTube appeared to have removed 89 videos linked to his account, many of them featuring Nazi imagery, shortly after the incident. Finnish media reported someone posted a message two weeks ago on the Web site, warning of a bloodbath at the school. A video posted earlier Wednesday, by ""Sturmgeist89,"" was titled ""Jokela High School Massacre - 11/7/2007."" ""Sturmgeist89"" identified himself as Auvinen, and said he chose the name ""Sturmgeist"" because it means ""storm spirit"" in German. The video showed a picture of the school, which then disintegrated to reveal two images of Auvinen against a red background, pointing a gun at the screen. The clip is accompanied by the song ""Stray Bullet"" from rock band KMFDM. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students behind the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, also cited that group's lyrics. Another short video clip, called ""Just Testing My Gun,"" showed Auvinen loading and cocking a handgun. He fired and hit several pieces of fruit in a wooded area; the camera then showed a close-up of the destroyed fruit, and then a full-screen shot of him again. He waved at the camera and then walked out of view. The site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing. As well as video footage of the Columbine school shootings, it also included clips of the 1993 Waco siege in the United States, the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo, and bombs falling on Baghdad during the 2003 invasion. Many showed victims being wheeled away or people running for their lives. Throughout all of this, the single word ""DIE"" constantly flashed across the screen. Other video clips included Nazi-war-criminal footage. In the rambling text posted on the site, Auvinen said that he is ""a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist. ""I am prepared to fight and die for my cause,"" he wrote. ""I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection."" The police said at this afternoon's press conference that they had been fired at when they arrived at the school at 11.45 p.m. local time (9.45 a.m. GMT). They described the scene as chaotic, with some of the 460 students, ranging in age from 12 to 18, breaking windows in an attempt to escape. When the police's special SWAT unit entered the high school they found the gunman unconscious and in critical condition in the lower lobby of the building with a gunshot wound to his head. Police assume he tried to take his own life as no officers fired at him. Several bodies were also found in the same location, where the shooting is believed to have begun, they added. They could not confirm comments by some students that Auvinen was firing through doors. Police also said that the gun Auvinen used, which was fully licensed, had been purchased less than a month ago on October 19. The legal age limit to own a gun in Finland is 18, which Auvinen passed in June of this year. He had a recommendation from a shooting club when he obtained the gun, police added, and practised sharp-shooting as a hobby at a shooting range. Finland, which enjoys a strong tradition of hunting, has a high proportion of gun ownership, with two million firearms owned in a nation of only five million. The Associated Press reported comments from Kim Kiuru, one of the school's teachers, on radio station YLE. Kiuru described how the headmistress used the public address system around noon to tell pupils to stay in classrooms. He said he locked his classroom door, then waited in the corridor for more news. ""After that I saw the gunman running with what appeared to be a small-caliber handgun in his hand through the doors towards me, after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction, "" Kiuru said. The agency reported Kiuru as saying that he saw a woman's body as he fled the school, before telling his pupils to leave the building through the windows. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

"I think it should be fixed on either UTC standard or UTC+1 year around, with the current zone offsets. Moving timescales add a lot of complexity to the implementation of timekeeping systems and have [dubious value]( I think seasonal shifting time made sense in the pre-electric past, when timekeeping was more flexible and artificial light was inefficient and often dangerous. Now we have machines that work easily with simple timekeeping rules, and it's more beneficial to spend a small amount on energy for lighting, and save the larger cost of engineering things to work with the complex timekeeping rules, as well as saving the irritation to humans. Lighting has gotten much more efficient over time; we can squeeze out a lot more photons per unit of energy from a 2012 CFL or LED than a candle could in 1780, or a lightbulb could in 1950. There's a lot of room for improvement in how we use lights as well; as lighting control gets more intelligent, there will be a lot of savings from not illuminating inactive spaces constantly. tl;dr: Shifting seasonal time is no longer worth it.",informal

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- A car bomb struck a U.S. Embassy vehicle Tuesday as it traveled along a coastal highway north of Beirut, killing at least three Lebanese civilian bystanders, according to American and Lebanese officials. Lebanese soldiers and Red Cross workers stand near charred cars at the site of the explosion in Beirut. The driver of the embassy vehicle suffered minor injuries, and the sole passenger walked away unscathed, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. Both were Lebanese nationals, he said. An American citizen who happened to be in the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the spokesman said. Lebanese internal security forces said three Lebanese civilian bystanders were killed in the explosion in Beirut's Dora area, contradicting earlier reports of four. Twenty-one others -- including the American bystander -- were wounded in the explosion, which was caused by a 15-kilogram (33-pound) bomb placed in a car before the explosion, the security forces said. The United States is outraged by the terrorist attack, said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is traveling with President Bush in Saudi Arabia. ""I want on behalf of our country to say to those who were wounded, and certainly to the families of those who were killed, that our condolences are with them,"" she added. It was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb. A communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack, and identified the driver and passenger as Lebanese security personnel for the embassy. But McCormack cautioned against jumping to any conclusions on the intended target. ""We don't yet have a full picture of exactly what happened, who is responsible, who is exactly being targeted,"" he told reporters during the State Department's daily briefing. ""We will see over the next day or two ... where the facts lead us."" Citing security concerns, McCormack would also not address unconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman. A U.S. Embassy statement said Feltman canceled a farewell ceremony that he was to host Tuesday night ""out of respect to the victims of today's terrorist explosion."" In addition to the American, an Iraqi and at least three Lebanese were among those wounded in the blast, according to a Western diplomatic source. Video of the scene showed several damaged cars, including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal. A nearby high-rise building also sustained damage. Mohammed Chatah, senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, pointed out that the attack happened during ""a major political crisis"" in Lebanon, which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud. ""This explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation,"" Chatah told CNN. Tuesday's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against pro-Western, anti-Syrian targets in the Lebanese capital. Most recently, an explosion in Beirut's Christian suburb of Baabda killed Brig. Gen. Francois Al-Hajj, the head of operations for the Lebanese army, and his bodyguard on December 12. Al-Hajj was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander in the event current commander Gen. Michel Suleiman was elected to replace Emile Lahoud as president. Lebanon has been in the midst of a political crisis as pro- and anti-Syrian lawmakers in parliament are locked in a battle to elect a new president. The nation has been without a president since November 23, when the pro-Syrian Lahoud stepped down at the end of his term. In February 2005, the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon. E-mail to a friend .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hours after declaring a state of emergency Saturday, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf ordered troops to take a television station's equipment and put a popular opposition leader under house arrest. President Pervez Musharraf explains his actions in a televised address Saturday. Musharraf also suspended the constitution and dismissed the Pakistan Supreme Court's chief justice for the second time. On Sunday, police arrested the Javed Hashmi, the acting president of ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's opposition party was arrested, along with 10 aides, The Associated Press reported. Hashimi was arrested when he stepped outside his house in the central city of Multan, AP reported. The country is at a critical and dangerous juncture -- threatened by rising tensions and spreading terrorism, Musharraf said in a televised address to the nation after declaring martial law. As Pakistani police patrolled the streets of the capital, Islamabad, Musharraf said his actions were ""for the good of Pakistan."" Watch Musharraf's speech » . There was quick condemnation from within and outside his country. The Supreme Court declared the state of emergency illegal, claiming Musharraf -- who also is Pakistan's military chief -- had no power to suspend the constitution, Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry said. Shortly afterward, government troops came to Chaudhry's office and told him the president had dismissed him from his job. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar was quickly appointed to replace him, according to state television. It was the second time Chaudhry was removed from his post. His ousting by Musharraf in March prompted massive protests, and he was later reinstated. See a timeline of upheaval in Pakistan » . Musharraf complained in his speech that the media -- which he made independent -- have not been supportive, but have reported ""negative"" news. Early Sunday, two dozen policemen raided the offices of AAJ-TV in Islamabad, saying they had orders to take the station's equipment. The government also issued a directive warning the media that any criticism of the president or prime minister would be punishable by three years in jail and a fine of up to $70,000, said Talat Hussain, director of news and current affairs for AAJ.

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- who is in Turkey for a conference with Iraq and neighboring nations -- said The United States doesn't support any extra-constitutional measures taken by Musharraf. ""The situation is just unfolding,"" Rice said. ""But anything that takes Pakistan off the democratic path, off the path of civilian rule is a step backward, and it's highly regrettable."" A senior Pakistani official said the emergency declaration will be ""short-lived,"" and will be followed by an interim government. Martial law is only a way to restore law and order, he said. Mahmud Ali Durrani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, agreed. ""I can assure you, he will move on the part of democracy that is promised ... and you will see that happen shortly."" Musharraf was re-elected president in October, but the election is not yet legally official, because the Supreme Court is hearing constitutional challenges to Musharraf's eligibility filed by the opposition. Under the constitution, Musharraf couldn't run for another term while serving both as president and military leader. The court allowed the election to go ahead, however, saying it would decide the issue later. Some speculated that the declaration of emergency is tied to rumors the court was planning to rule against Musharraf. Musharraf has said repeatedly he will step down as military leader before the next term begins on November 15 and has promised to hold parliamentary elections by January 15. Meanwhile, popular opposition leader Imran Khan said early Sunday that police surrounded his house in Lahore, barged in and told him he was under house arrest. Musharraf also had Khan placed under house arrest during a government crackdown in March 2006. Asked about Musharraf's actions Saturday, Khan said, ""We are going to oppose this in every way."" ""None of us accept ... this whole drama about emergency.""

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Azerbaijan recently uncovered a radical Islamic terror plot against the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Baku, prompting the facility to close its doors to the public Monday, Azerbaijan and U.S. officials told CNN. The Bibi Heybat Mosque, just outside the capital Baku. As a precaution, Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday ""following security concerns nearby,"" Britain's Foreign Office said. The terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group, two U.S. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry told CNN. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details ""are still unfolding,"" and the threat ""may or may not be"" linked to the Saturday raid. ""There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the U.S. Embassy there,"" McCormack said, noting that no specific individuals were targeted. Several days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of Baku, the ministry spokesman and U.S. officials said. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Baku, the spokesman said. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said. Several others are still at large, he added. He said the terror plot also targeted Azerbaijani government buildings. The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. ""While there is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted, the U.S. Embassy encourages Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security,"" it said. Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran. McCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well. E-mail to a friend .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Dressed in a Superman shirt, 5-year-old Youssif held his sister's hand Friday, seemingly unaware that millions of people across the world have been touched by his story. Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Youssif holds his sister's hand Friday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. ""I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,"" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. ""I didn't think the reaction would be this big."" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. ""We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,"" he said. ""We knew there was kindness out there."" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving ""no stone unturned"" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case. Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring » . Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations. You can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu under the ""general donation"" area that is marked ""Youssif's fund."" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. ""We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,"" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. ""We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries."" She added, ""He will be getting the absolute best care that's available."" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. ""I will do anything for Youssif,"" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. ""Our child is everything."" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act. CNN Iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border. In a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world, it was a refreshing realization. E-mail to a friend .

A thick plume of smoke rises Wednesday at a chemical plant in Jacksonville, Florida. ""Literally, it's a hellish inferno. There is no other way to describe it,"" said Fire Department spokesman Tom Francis. Fourteen people were hospitalized after the blast at the T2 Lab on Faye Road, in an industrial area on the waterfront in north Jacksonville, Francis said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Allegations that Blackwater USA -- whose operations were suspended after 20 Iraqi civilians were shot to death last weekend -- was ""in any way associated or complicit in unlawful arms activities are baseless,"" the company asserted Saturday. Blackwater employees patrol Baghdad by air in a February 2005 photograph. Federal prosecutors are investigating allegations that employees of Blackwater illegally purchased weapons and sold them in Iraq, according to U.S. government sources. A U.S. government official has said the U.S. attorney's office in Raleigh, North Carolina, is in the early stages of an investigation that focuses on individual company employees, and not the firm. Blackwater, which is based in Moyock, North Carolina, is a security firm hired by the State Department to guard U.S. staff in Iraq. ""The company has no knowledge of any employee improperly exporting weapons,"" the Blackwater statement said. ""When it was uncovered internally that two employees were stealing from the company, Blackwater immediately fired them and invited the ATF to conduct a thorough investigation."" Watch a report on Blackwater's response to the allegations » . The first public hint that an investigation was under way came earlier this week in a statement from State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard after he was accused of blocking fraud investigations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Krongard said the State Department has been cooperating with the prosecutors in the Blackwater probe. ""In particular, I made one of my best investigators available to help assistant U.S. attorneys in North Carolina in their investigation into alleged smuggling of weapons into Iraq by a contractor,"" Krongard's statement said. Blackwater resumed normal security operations in Iraq on Friday, the State Department said, after a brief hiatus following the lethal incident last Sunday. The Iraqi government was outraged by the shootings and disputes the U.S. and Blackwater's claim that the guards were responding to an attack. E-mail to a friend .

A lot of people may find that I am pandering, but after years of hating my body, the size of my breasts and crying over how ""Nothing fits (at an affordable cost)"" I decided to just get over it. None of my shirts properly button up. The top button is not my friend. (read: it never closes) This is something I have to deal with. I'm currently a graduate student working on my thesis looking at sexual harassment on the XBLN, gamer girl identity and gender negotiation.

For instance: I'll never forget when I first came into my program a lot of the students were unsure where they wanted to take their research. I know where my research is heading towards and how I'm collecting my data, etc. I went to talk to one professor because he is well versed within media literacy and thought he'd be a great help. Instead of listening to anything I was trying to tell him, he starred at my tits the whole time, interrupting me and making me feel humiliated. I wasn't a person to him in that moment, but a sex object. I felt myself getting frustrated. Red in the face. Angry. Finally without even looking me at the face he asked if I had any questions. Licked his lips. Disgusting. I just wanted to get out of there. I said no, and as I was turning to leave, he had the nerve to touch me. Place his hand on my shoulder.

You're not supporting the article solely with your comment, so I don't think you should be getting quite so downvoted.

And his followup was over-the-top insulting. Normally, I would re-read something to give specific quotes and details, but it upsets me way too much to be worth it.

It would be totally fine. That's true! It's a true thing to say! It's not speaking in absolutes and it doesn't minimize people's experiences. The actual article, however, does. The article wasn't written to change anyone's mind, but it was framed like it was. Because the premise is one that would be useful to reach out to people who haven't thought much about gender politics or who are more moderate on those issues. It devolved from a decent premise into a ""you don't know how hard life *really* is"" and started belaboring the point using insular language and making lots of referential nods to existing feminist culture.

"(CNN) -- A former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear energy-related materials and putting the United States at risk, the Department of Justice announced Thursday. Sources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park. Roy Lynn Oakley, 67, of Roane County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in Knoxville on Thursday. Oakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials, government sources told CNN. He voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office in Knoxville, the sources said. Oakley is a former employee of Bechtel Jacobs, the Department of Energy's prime environmental management contractor at the East Tennessee Technology Park, prosecutors said. The indictment states that Oakley, ""having possession of, access to and having been entrusted with sections of 'barriers' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the United States and secure an advantage to a foreign nation, did communicate, transmit and disclose such data to another person."" The transfer took place January 26, the indictment alleges. Oakley is also charged with converting the material and ""restricted data"" to his own use. He began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them. Oakley's attorney, Herb Moncier, said outside court Thursday that Oakley's job was to break rods ""into little pieces"" and throw them away. Moncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance. The government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the ""pieces of scrap"" to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, Moncier said. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an ""appliance"" under the law. ""Mr. Oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months,"" said Moncier, who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case. Each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. ""While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands,"" Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement. One government source said the materials involved are not the ""crown jewels,"" but they should not have been taken from the facility. A ""barrier"" is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job. Sources told CNN that federal authorities have been following Oakley and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material. Oakley, described as a low-level employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said. A government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakley's alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation. The FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country. East Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOE's Oak Ridge reservation ""where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985,"" Gerald Boyd, manager of the DOE's Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday. ""When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium."" Boyd said the technology park and the reservation ""are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs, both visible and unseen, meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position."" In this case, a review of security procedures showed that the system worked and ""successfully identified the individual in question,"" he said. E-mail to a friend .

In the long term, there is more than just chemistry. The new car smell in the relationship fades, and then you see truths you didn't see before. Ignoring those flaws will make for a bad bad relationship, no matter what kind it is. I've experienced this myself and seen it before.

I want to really send this message home, two people can fall in love and even stick together for 3-9 months with great chemistry. But is that the goal? For many, absolutely, but then why bother with okcupid at all? Why not just find someone you can tolerate at a bar or plentyoffish? I think many on okcupid aren't looking for a fling or some sort of short term thing. I think they really want something like marriage or someone to spend their life with and have kids with and so on.

"Council Regulation (EC) No 334/2002 of 18 February 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 laying down a uniform format for visas THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(b)(iii) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2), Whereas: (1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95(3) laid down a uniform format for visas. (2) Measure No 38 of the Vienna Action Plan, adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 3 December 1998, states that attention must be given to new technical developments in order to ensure, where appropriate, greater security in the uniform format for visas. (3) Conclusion No 22 of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 states that a common active policy on visas and false documents should be further developed. (4) The establishment of a uniform visa format is an essential element in the harmonisation of visa policy. (5) It is necessary to make provision for the establishment of common standards relating to the implementation of the uniform format for visas, in particular common rules on the technical methods and standards to be used for filling in the form. (6) The integration of a photograph produced according to high security standards is a first step towards the use of elements establishing a more reliable link between the uniform format visa and the holder as an important contribution to ensuring that the uniform format for visas is protected even against fraudulent use. The specifications set out in ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) document 9303 on machine readable visas will be taken into account. (7) Common standards relating to the implementation of the uniform format for visas are essential to meet high technical standards and to facilitate detection of forged or falsified visa stickers. (8) The powers to adopt such common standards should be conferred on the Committee set up by Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 which should be adapted to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4). (9) Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 should therefore be amended. (10) The measures provided for in this Regulation to make the uniform format for visas more secure do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents. (11) The conditions governing entry into the territory of the Member States or the issue of visas do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents. (12) As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis falling within the area referred to in Article 1, point B, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(5).

(14) In accordance with Article 1 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation. As a result, and without prejudice to Article 4 of the said Protocol, the provisions of this Regulation do not apply to Ireland, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 is hereby amended as follows: 1.

"They also provide the first direct evidence that there may be as much water trapped in those rocks as there is in all the oceans. The diamond, from central-west Brazil, contains minerals that formed as deep as 600km down and that have significant amounts of water trapped within them. Researchers have published their findings in the journal Nature. The study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets. Diamonds, brought to the Earth's surface in violent eruptions of deep volcanic rocks called kimberlites, provide a tantalising window into the deep Earth. A research team led by Prof Graham Pearson of the University of Alberta, Canada, studied a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite found in Juina, Brazil, as part of a wider project. They noticed that it contained a mineral, ringwoodite, that is only thought to form between 410km and 660km beneath the Earth's surface, showing just how deep some diamonds originate. While ringwoodite has previously been found in meteorites, this is the first time a terrestrial ringwoodite has been seen. But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water. While this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water. Dr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: ""Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface."" The observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches. Discussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: ""The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth. ""It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres."" Describing his diamond sample, he said: ""It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has."" Prof Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory. He said: ""I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets. ""This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy."" A key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets. Ringwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core. Grains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope. Given the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term ""blue planet"" seems even more appropriate for Earth.",formal

In the interest of clarity, the provisions of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 should be redrafted accordingly. (2) The possibility to apply for and issue the surveillance document electronically should be introduced. In that context, it is necessary to amend Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 in order to allow the electronic submission of the request concerning that document. (3) The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 concerning the committee procedure should be adapted to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5). (4) The procedure under Article 25(4) of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 relating to the introduction of emergency safeguard measures under Article 13 of that Regulation is a variant of the former ""IIIB"" procedure which is no longer valid. It is appropriate to apply, for the application of emergency safeguard measures, the procedure for the application of safeguards foreseen by Article 6(c), first alternative, of Decision 1999/468/EC. (5) The procedure for the application of standard safeguard measures contained in Article 25(5) of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 corresponds to the procedure set out in Article 6(c), second alternative, of Decision 1999/468/EC, which is appropriate for the application of such safeguard measures. (6) The procedure for the application of surveillance measures under Title III of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 should therefore be the same as that for the application of normal safeguard measures, namely that foreseen in Article 6(c), second alternative, of Decision 1999/468/EC, since the two types of measure are closely linked. (7) For reasons of clarity it is appropriate to replace the whole provisions of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 relating to the Committee procedure.

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Drivers who were on the Minneapolis bridge when it collapsed told harrowing tales of survival. ""The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down,"" survivor Gary Babineau told CNN. ""I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall. And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down."" He said his back was injured but he determined he could move around. ""I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones."" Watch a driver describe his narrow escape » . At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. ""I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling,"" Babineau said. ""It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies."" Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. ""I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall,"" he said. ""So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. ""I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos."" He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries. See rescuers clamber over rubble » . Babineau said he had no rescue training. ""I just knew what I had to do at the moment."" Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. ""You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice,"" Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. ""I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car,"" she told AP. ""It's really very surreal."" Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: ""On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead. ""My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the ground, and my truck got ripped in half. It was folded in half, and I can't believe I'm alive."" See and hear eyewitness accounts » . Bernie Toivonen told CNN's ""American Morning"" that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle. ""I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A girl who was shown on a videotape being sexually assaulted in Las Vegas has been found and is safe, officials in Nye County, Nevada, said Friday. Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, is being sought as a suspect, police say. ""We have found the child, Madison. She's safe. The detectives say she is in good condition,"" Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said. The girl, now 7, was shown in a sex video made four years ago, Detective David Boruchowitz said at a news conference Friday night. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture. CNN and other news organizations did so until the child was found, when De Meo asked them to stop showing the picture. ""The mother has cooperated with us,"" De Meo said. ""We believe that the mother was not aware of anything that went on with this young girl,"" he said. ""It was very sad for her to find this out."" A former Las Vegas animal trainer, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, has been identified as a suspect and is being sought in the case, De Meo said. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas. Watch what's known about Stiles » . Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said. Someone close to Stiles has told investigators that Stiles is a ""survivalist type"" and always carries a weapon, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett said. De Meo addressed Stiles directly: ""Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency,"" he said. ""Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm, but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency."" The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said. Police, who had called Stiles a person of interest, began calling him a suspect late Friday. There appeared to be physical similarities between Stiles and the man in the videotape, De Meo said. ""Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through. Whoever this person is is a predator that, as far as I'm concerned, belongs in custody and, if successfully prosecuted, in jail for as long as the law allows,"" De Meo said earlier. Detectives said the child showed little emotion during the rapes, indicating she may have been brutalized before. Nevadan Darren Tuck recently gave police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, De Meo said. Police said the tape was in his possession at least since May before he handed it over to authorities. He is being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support, but police -- who want to question him further -- have been unable to locate him. Tuck, who also allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible 10-years-to-life sentence for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, De Meo said. Harry Kuehn, Tuck's attorney, said this week on CNN's ""Nancy Grace"" that Tuck was ""racked by indecision"" about what to do with the tape once he realized what it was. Asked why, Kuehn said, ""He's explained that to us, and at this point, we're not going to share that, because it goes to the defense of the matter."" ""You have to consider what kind of concerns my client had; He's previously dealt with the sheriff's office in Nye County; it was previously unsatisfactory,"" the attorney said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The illegal export of U.S. military technology to Iran and China poses a growing threat, the Justice Department said Thursday as it announced plans to combat the practice. Iran is the only country still flying the F-14 Tomcat. The department said the United States will tighten monitoring of export licenses and increase export restrictions on technologies that could have both civilian and military applications and could pose a danger to U.S. national security in the hands of terrorists or potential enemies. ""China and Iran pose particular U.S. export control concerns,"" the Justice Department said in a statement issued Thursday. ""Recent prosecutions have highlighted illegal exports of stealth missile technology, military aircraft components, naval warship data, night vision equipment, and other restricted technology destined for China or Iran."" Representatives of more than a half dozen federal agencies will jointly announce their plans at a Justice Department news conference Thursday. Officials plan to highlight two recent cases. In the past week a Pittsburgh company, SparesGlobal Inc., was sentenced for lying about an illegal export of products that can be used in nuclear reactions and in the nose cones of ballistic missiles.

"LONDON, England -- Milan goalkeeper Dida has been cleared to play in next month's Champions League match at Shakhtar Donetsk after partially winning his appeal to UEFA against a two-match ban. Dida has had one game of his two-match ban suspended for a year following an appeal to UEFA. Brazilian Dida was also fined 60,000 Swiss francs by European football's ruling body following an incident involving a supporter during the Champions clash against Celtic in Scotland on October 3. The 34-year-old Brazilian was initially banned for two games for his theatrics following a Celtic fan's encroachment onto the pitch during the 2-1 defeat at Celtic Park. ""Following Monday's appeals hearing, Dida is suspended for two matches, but one of the matches will now be deferred for a probationary period of one year,"" said a stement on UEFA's Web site. Dida sits out the home tie against Shakhtar on Wednesday after an inquiry based on Article 5, paragraph 1 of the UEFA disciplinary regulations (Principles of conduct), under which ""member associations, clubs, as well as their players, officials and members, shall conduct themselves according to the principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship"". However, Dida will only serve the second match of his ban if he commits a similar offense -- a theatrical over-reaction --during the next 12 months, freeing him for the trip to Ukraine.

"(CNN) -- The late Chris Benoit idolized the Dynamite Kid, who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular high-flying, acrobatic moves. Chris Benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in June. The Dynamite Kid and his partner, Davey Boy Smith, were known as the British Bulldogs. They were quick, agile and muscular, and in 1986 they won the World Wrestling Federation tag team championship. Young Benoit dreamed of wrestling like the Dynamite Kid, whose real name is Tom Billington. At the beginning of his career, Benoit adopted the Dynamite nickname and copied his idol's signature moves. In June, Benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself. Investigators found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in Chris Benoit's body, Georgia's chief medical examiner said a month later. When asked about Benoit's double murder-suicide, Billington told CNN, ""It can make you aggressive, the steroids. But personally I wouldn't, you know, kill no bleeding kid, or wife either."" Billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside Manchester, England. He has lost the use of his legs. A pin sticks out from one of his toes. Billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body. And from the steroids, he said. Billington told CNN that the steroids came from doctors, from friends, even from steroids meant for horses. He took them all, took a terrible pounding in the ring, and like his partner (who died at age 39 in 2002), began taking extensive amounts of painkillers. Benoit's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, and the man who has ruled wrestling for years, Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon. McMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN: ""Nothing from the WWE, under any set of circumstances had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family. How did we know Chris Benoit would turn into a monster."" Read a full transcript of the McMahons interview . Vince McMahon defended the organization, saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show. ""Our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else's in sport, although again emphasizing we are entertainment, and no one in entertainment, no one has this kind of wellness policy,"" McMahon said. Critics say McMahon pushes his stars and non-stars, works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling. They say McMahon only looks at his employees as commodities, pawns in a huge business. His businesses are quite successful. About 16 million people a week tune into WWE TV shows. Two of their cable programs -- ""Raw"" and ""Friday Night Smackdown"" -- are weekly ratings giants. Pay-per-view specials generate an average of $100 million per year. When asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old, Vince McMahon said each person in the WWE bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena. ""If someone passes through our organization, it is not our responsibility for someone's personal activities,"" he said. He also said there isn't ""any organization in the world, be it entertainment or be it sport, that can tell you that they are totally drug-free."" Watch as a WWE wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong » . The McMahons said the WWE is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes. Since the newest WWE drug screening program began in February 2006, more than 30 of the organization's wrestlers have been suspended, including two since CNN's interview with the McMahons. David Black -- who helped the NFL develop its drug program and now runs tests for the WWE -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning. But Dr. Gary Wadler, a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes, says the WWE is not doing enough. ""It certainly falls far, far short of where it needs to be,"" he said. ""And there is a gold standard, and I measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard. And [the WWE is] miles apart."" Wadler, a longtime critic of McMahon, was referring to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in Colorado Springs, Colorado. U.S. athletes training for the Olympics are randomly tested and, if caught just once, face a two-year suspension from competition. If caught a second time, they can be banned for life. Black's programs test wrestlers four times a year. The first is a ""baseline"" test, according to the WWE. Black then tests for ""nonmedical"" uses, meaning that if an athlete has a prescription, he is cleared. ""It's just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program,"" said Travis Tygart, who heads the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. McMahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids. He says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years. Watch one of the new WWE stars talk about being ""straight edge"" » . ""There's an expression in our business, that here is where you make your money. It's your face, it's what you do with it,"" he said. ""It's your personality, it's what you do with it. It's your delivery, your elocution. It's storyline, it's things, all those things that are theatrical as well as athletic in the ring."" E-mail to a friend .

Relevant Stats(DPS 37k, Crt 38%, 1.8 AS, ~42k life, ~500Resist, ~5.5k-6k Armor, 19 APoC, ~900LoH) First off, does Spectral Blades - Deep Cuts proc CM? Yes. Tried it myself. I hit some mobs, used my Diamond skin and clearly saw it reducing my cooldown in large chunks. Was the coefficient changed at all? I dunno, it's been so long since I used Spectral Blades, but on one of those large numbered groups in A3 it seemed to proc quite often. Act 3(MP0): Wow, they really nerfed it. This might be fun to try new specs with, as more that wouldn't be viable due to high dmg before could now be workable. Might not be the most efficient way to farm, but if you want to mix things up then why not? Enemies die very fast. Act 3(MP3-4): Getting harder. Seems about where Inferno is now. Act 3(MP5): Alright, their health is now pretty high. To high for me to want to farm with my current DPS. Damage done to me is noticeably higher, and I've died from some real nasty spike damage. If you have trouble keeping stuff frozen, and you run into a nasty affix combo, you're gonna have a bad time. Act 3 MP(10). Tried this with another wizard, and while we killed an easy affix pack, monster health is just to high to make me want to run it. Normal mobs can hit like a truck and if you lag on your windup, you're dead. I also tried some low MP Act 1, and while I enjoy being able to get top quality loot, the enemies are to spread out for it to be efficient farming. It's nice for a change of scenery, but that's all. As for how the spec feels? Alright. Not as OP as before, but still works. I usually toss out 2 WW and then a SB hit to put up the bleeds to help reset cooldowns. I run with the cooldown reduction passive rune(can't remember name atm) and that seems to be enough. Some might want to think about taking the reduce cooldown rune for Frost Nova if your crit or attack speed is low. TL;DR Spectral Blades - Deep Cuts still procs CM from the bleed, Windup Wizard is still viable with some moderate gear and high crit, MP0 is super easy, MP3-4 feels like it does now, MP5+ enemy HP is to high to make it feel worth the time.",informal
"The IPC opened proceedings against the National Paralympic Committee of Russia after a report claimed the country had operated a widespread doping programme. A decision on any ban will come in the week commencing 1 August. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has opted against a blanket ban. ""I can assure you that our board will take the right decision in the interest of sport and the interest of the Paralympic movement moving forward,"" said Craven. On Sunday, the IOC said it would leave it up to the governing bodies of individual sports to decide if Russian competitors are clean and should be allowed to take part. But Craven, himself a member of the IOC, was critical of that decision and said the IPC would not necessarily follow suit. ""I am disappointed in their decision, but that is a personal view,"" he added. ""We have to acknowledge their right to take such a decision. This is ultra-serious. I don't think there has been a situation in the past where you have had institutional doping on such a scale.

Nineteen samples potentially doctored as part of the sample-swapping regime during the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Winter Games have been sent for further analysis.

"If you're new to things, I would recommend running pre-written adventures to start with, so that you can get a feel for what you need to run a game and what you're comfortable improvising. One of the greatest strengths of Pathfinder is the excellent adventures that Paizo puts out, so I don't see any reason to skip out on them, especially if you're not comfortable yet. Drawing maps, I mostly do by hand if it's actually necessary. Get a feel for the general layout of the region and sketch it out for your PCs. Keep a copy and scan it into your computer so you can reference it later. Add on to it as they explore, but don't too far beyond, say, a starting town and its immediate environs. For a starting group that's all they will need for a little while, if you set things up so that there are several adventure hooks in the region. Thinking up the world is mostly theft. Find things you like from a bunch of different sources, then mix and match what fits together in interesting ways. My home setting is a mix of a bunch of different influences - Eberron, World of Warcraft, Song of Ice and Fire, Magic: The Gathering, even some Star Trek. I take things I like from other stuff, warp it so it's not quite as obvious, and then bam! I have an interesting setting element. Running campaigns, to me, is about figuring out who opposes the PCs, what they want, and what resources they have to accomplish those goals. Plots flow from how the PCs muck up those plans and resources, and how those plots cause problems for other NPCs that might ask the PCs for help. When should there be a fight? It depends on the group, of course, but once per session isn't a bad idea. I generally don't do more than that unless it's a fairly long or action-packed session (though it depends a lot on what kind of games you run - dungeon crawls will almost always have several fights, whereas investigation games with heavy roleplaying might not have that many). It takes time to learn to read the mood of the group to figure out when they want action and when they want to relax into some longer roleplaying. Watch your players - are they fidgeting, looking at their phones, stacking dice? If so, up the action. Are they smiling, talking to each other in character, and having a good time interacting?

"Commission Regulation (EC) No 1443/2003 of 13 August 2003 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of rice from the 1999 harvest held by the Italian intervention agency THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2), and in particular Article 8(b) thereof, Whereas: (1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 75/91(3) provides, among other things, that paddy rice held by intervention agencies is to be sold by tendering procedure at prices preventing market disturbance. (2) Italy still has intervention stocks of paddy rice from the 1999 harvest whose quality is in danger of deteriorating as a result of prolonged storage. (3) In the present production situation where concessions for rice imports are being granted under international agreements and restrictions are being applied to subsidised exports, disposing of this rice on traditional markets inside the Community would inevitably result in an equivalent quantity being placed in intervention, which must be avoided. (4) This rice can be disposed of by processing it into broken rice or into a form suitable for use in animal feed, on certain conditions. (5) In order to ensure that the rice really is processed, the procedure should be specially monitored and the successful tenderer should provide a security, to be released on conditions to be laid down. (6) The undertakings given by tenderers must be regarded as primary requirements within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(5). (7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 770/96(7), lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use of products from intervention. Procedures should also be laid down to ensure the traceability of the products used for animal feed. (8) So that the quantities awarded can be managed accurately, an allocation coefficient should be fixed for tenders offering the minimum selling price, while allowing tenderers to specify a minimum quantity awarded below which they do not wish their tender to stand. (9) When the Italian intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous. (10) While respecting the tenderers' anonymity, they should be identified by numbers so that it is evident which have submitted several tenders and what prices they have offered. (11) For control purposes, tenders must be traceable by their reference numbers, while safeguarding anonymity. (12) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail. (13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 The Italian intervention agency shall launch a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the internal market of the Community of quantities of rice from the 1999 harvest, held by it and previously notified to the Commission under Regulation (EEC) No 75/91, in particular Articles 2 and 5 thereof, as set out in Annex I hereto, with a view to its processing into broken rice within the meaning of Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, or into a form suitable for use in animal feed (CN code 2309 ).

Once submitted, a tender may not be altered or withdrawn. 3. In case the Commission is required to fix an award coefficient for the quantities offered for sale as provided for in the second paragraph of Article 7, tenderers should indicate any minimum awarded quantity below which they do not wish their tender to stand.

The Italian intervention agency shall notify the Commission of the information as specified in Annex V, by type of processing, no later than 9.00 (Brussels time) on the Thursday following the expiry of the deadline for the submission of tenders. 2. For each type of processing and for each partial tendering procedure, the tenderers shall be assigned an individual number, starting at 1, by the Italian intervention agency. To ensure anonymity, the numbers shall be allocated randomly and separately for each type of processing and each partial tendering procedure. The reference numbers of each tender shall be given by the Italian intervention agency in such a way as to ensure that the tenderers remain anonymous. For the entire standing tendering procedure, each tender shall be identified by its own reference number. 3. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made by electronic mail to the address given in Annex V using the form provided to the Italian intervention agency by the Commission for that purpose. The notification must be made even if no tenders are submitted. In that case, it must state that no tenders have been received within the deadline laid down. 4. The Italian intervention agency shall also notify the Commission of the information as specified in Annex V for rejected tenders, stating why they were rejected. Article 7 For each type of processing, the Commission shall set the minimum sale price or decide not to award any quantities. In the event that tenders are submitted for the same lot and for a quantity larger than that available, the Commission may fix this price separately for each lot. Where tenders offer the minimum sale price, the Commission may fix an award coefficient for the quantities offered at the same time as it fixes the minimum sale price. This Decision shall be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95. Article 8 The intervention agency shall immediately notify all tenderers of the outcome of their participation in the tendering procedure. Within three working days of the notification referred to in the first paragraph, it shall send notices of award of contract to successful tenderers by registered letter or written telecommunication.

Following the expiry of the payment period, rice for which a contract is awarded and which is not removed shall be regarded for all purposes as having been removed from storage. Where a successful tenderer fails to pay for the rice within the period referred to in the first paragraph, the contract shall be terminated by the intervention agency, where appropriate in respect of the quantity not paid for.

"The 67-year-old suffered a broken collarbone when he was knocked to the ground outside his Gateshead home in January. An online appeal set up by beautician Katie Cutler raised £330,135. Richard Gatiss, 25, from Gateshead, had pleaded guilty to assault with intent to rob at Newcastle Crown Court. After the sentencing, Mr Barnes said it was ""just about the right length of time"" and he hoped prison would give Gatiss time to reflect on what he had done. ""I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful,"" he said. Gatiss, from Split Crow Road, was caught after police retrieved DNA evidence from a pocket on Mr Barnes' jacket. He had been desperate for money to buy legal highs but ran off empty-handed when Mr Barnes shouted for help, the court heard. Judge Paul Sloan QC described Gatiss' actions as ""despicable and opportunistic"" and said he had picked on Mr Barnes because he was vulnerable. Mr Barnes has lived with disabilities from birth after his mother contracted German measles when she was pregnant. He is visually impaired and stands 4ft 6in (1.21m) tall. After the hearing, Mr Barnes, who was joined by 21-year-old Miss Cutler, said: ""I'm pleased he's been sentenced and I think the sentence of four years is just about the right length. ""I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful. Maybe he might decide to help people, which I think would be a good idea for him. ""It's sad that he was brought to the stage of doing something like this - not necessarily just me, it could have been anybody and they might not have got over the incident. ""But I've moved on,"" he said. Holding back tears, Miss Cutler added: ""It's hard for me to talk about Richard as it wasn't me who was attacked, but I just hope he gets the help that he deserves. ""I'm just glad that that some good has come from this and we can move forward."" While on remand, Gatiss was kept in segregation for his own safety. Jamie Adams, defending, said it was ""an awful case"" but publicity surrounding it made it difficult to ""keep a proper outlook on what the sentence should be"". On the prison bus to court Gatiss had been ""the subject of some pretty awful double-standard behaviour"" from other inmates, Mr Adams said. ""Life is not easy for him.

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. Bobby Murcer's biggest fan . Former New York Yankee Bobby Murcer warms up during Old Timers Day Yankee Stadium on July 7. Our first story has a fairy-tale middle and a horrible ending. In August of '77, Bobby Murcer of the Cubs promised to hit a home run for terminally ill fan Scott Crull. That night, Murcer hit two of them. Pretty amazing, especially when you consider Murcer only hit nine homers the whole next season. But that's not why Crull -- a 12-year-old from Calumet City, Illinois -- makes this list. Broadcasting the game nationally on ABC, Keith Jackson told the country how Murcer had fulfilled the dying boy's last wish. Eyes watered, spines tingled. There was only one problem -- nobody had ever told the boy he was dying. His parents were horrified. Weeks later, Crull passed away. 2. The good luck charmers . Every sport has its own strange traditions. I'd argue hockey's ""throwing an octopus on the ice for good luck"" is the weirdest. Tossing the eight-tentacled cephalopod was the brainchild of Detroit storeowners Pete & Jerry Cusimano. The date: April 15, 1952. The logic: one tentacle for each of the eight victories it took to win the Stanley Cup. Later that spring, most likely fueled by the good luck octopus, the Red Wings won the title. PETA has objected to this practice, which continues to this day. The Red Wings mascot is not a Red Wing, but Al the Octopus. 3. The John 3:16 guy . Also known as ""Rainbow Man,"" the born-again Rollen Stewart and his John 3:16 signs were fixtures at major events in the 1970s and 80s. He brought his message to the World Series, Super Bowl, Olympics, and World Cup. He was outside Buckingham Palace when Di and Charles wed; he went to see the Pope in Alaska. But he was more religious fanatic than sports fan. According to the Los Angeles Times, Stewart planned to assassinate President Bush and candidate Clinton in 1992. And he's now serving three life sentences for holding a maid hostage at a Los Angeles Hyatt, also in 1992. By the way, chapter three, verse sixteen of the Gospel of John says, ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" This is also printed on cups at the In-N-Out Burger. 4. The All-Star heckler . For 12 years, Maryland lawyer and Washington Bullets fan Robin Ficker was the NBA's most prominent heckler. With season tickets behind the visiting team's bench, his antics were legendary. When he reminded Frank Layden of the Jazz that ""USA Today"" had rated him Worst Dressed Coach, Layden had to be restrained by security. With the Bulls in town, Ficker loudly read excerpts of Maverick, coach Phil Jackson's sex-laden 1975 autobiography. During the 1993 Suns-Bulls NBA Finals, Charles Barkley (of the Suns) flew Ficker to Phoenix and bought him a ticket behind the Chicago bench. Ficker was ejected in the first quarter. The Bullets became the Wizards in 1997 and moved into the MCI Center the following season. Ficker's new seats were not in shouting distance of the visiting team, forcing him into heckling retirement. Last year he received 9.5% of the vote in a losing bid for Montgomery County Executive. 5. Kim Jong-il . That's right, the world's most feared dictator is a hoops junkie. During a 2000 visit, then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright presented him a basketball signed by Michael Jordan. The Chicago Bulls are the favorite team of Kim Jong-il, who reportedly has a video library with every game Jordan ever played. At 5'3"", the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army is roughly the same height as Muggsy Bogues. 6. David Letterman's Stalker . David Letterman's biggest fan was also his biggest headache. When she was arrested for stealing Dave's Porsche in 1988, Margaret Ray told police she was Mrs. Letterman. She was a frequent trespasser on Dave's estate, once camping out on his tennis court. Ray's antics made her a regular monologue target. But the jokes stopped in 1998, when Ray jumped in front of a moving train. The collective guilt spread when we learned she was schizophrenic, as were her two brothers, who also committed suicide. 7. Joe from Saddle River . A die-hard Jets, Mets and Rangers fan, Joe Benigno was a frequent caller to WFAN, New York's all-sports radio station. Benigno won the station's Fan Appreciation Day contest in 1994, earning a chance to guest-host his own show. By 1995, Joe was WFAN's overnight guy, a title he held for almost a decade. In 2004, he was deemed ready for daytime and given the 10 a.m.-1p.m. timeslot. For all the lonely and passionate talk radio callers out there, Joe gives hope. 8. Steffi Graf's biggest fanatic . Deranged and obsessed with seeing Steffi Graf return to the top of the rankings, Gunter Parche stabbed Monica Seles during a 1993 match in one of the most disturbing incidents in sports history. Almost as disturbing was his punishment. Parche received a two-year suspended sentence and was ordered to attend mandatory counseling.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Banksy is Britain's most wanted artist -- his art sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars, but he continues to use public spaces as his main canvas, while all the time keeping his identity a secret. Banksy's latest piece in East London where a passer-by claims to have taken a photo of the artist. The guerilla artist has been spray painting his stencils around Britain and further afield for over ten years. Last week ten of his original pieces were sold at Bonham's auction house in London for over $1 million, while on the other side of the city Tower Hamlets council authority pledged to remove his graffiti from its streets. From his beginnings as a graffiti artist in Bristol, England, Banksy has become the darling of the art world for his subversive and satirical public art. Depicting things such as riot police with smiley acid-house faces and camera-wielding rats, his work is now sold now by major art galleries. Lazarides Gallery in London is one of the main dealers of his work and describes him as ""a media star...but popular long before any of this high-profile activity -- simply because the people love his stuff."" While he set out to lampoon the establishment, he has now been wholeheartedly embraced by it. Fans include Hollywood A-listers, including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Christina Aguilera who bought three of his prints in 2006, including one of Queen Victoria sitting on a woman's face. The recent sales of his work put him on a par with Jean-Michel Basquiat as the best-selling street artist. He is feted by art dealers and artists, including Damien Hirst, but he regularly mocks the art world that is so enthralled by him with ingenious stunts such as hanging his own work in the Tate gallery in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It took the British Museum eight days to discover the ""prehistoric"" rock painting of a man with a shopping trolley in the British Museum Banksy has hung on a wall. There is often a political message with this work, too. He left an inflatable doll dressed as a Guantanamo prisoner in Disneyland and painted a hole with blue sky on the Palestinian side of the West Bank wall. Despite the huge popularity and exposure of his work, Banksy's identity remains a mystery. As he operates on the fringes of the law with his guerilla art it makes sense, but also adds to his mystique. Some things are know: he's originally from Bristol, is around 30 years old and called Robert or Robin Banks, but it's been reported that even his parents are thought to believe that he makes his living as a painter and decorator. He continues to divide opinion as to whether his work is vandalism or public art. Veteran British art critic Brian Sewell called Banksy, ""a complete clown, and what he does has absolutely nothing to do with art."" Bristol city council has recognized the popularity and artistic merit of his work by protecting a number of pieces around the city. Other local authorities don't feel the same way. Tower Hamlets and Hackney councils in London have pledged to remove his graffiti from their streets. His latest work painted on a wall in East London -- a man in overalls resting next to a giant flower drawn as a continuation from the double yellow lines on the road -- is thought to be the artist's response. But this latest piece may also have revealed what the artist actually looks like. A passer-by took a photo of what is thought to be the artist at work. A spokesperson for Banksy refused to confirm it was him, but did say it was definitely his work. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"Shamsul Arefin brought four people from his native Bangladesh to work at the Stewart Hotel near Appin in Argyll over a three year period. His victims took out loans to pay him substantial sums for employment at the hotel. One was threatened with having his kidney removed by money lenders back home if he didn't pay his debt. Arefin's crimes were described as a ""clear case of modern day slavery"". At Fort William Sheriff Court, he was found guilty of breaches of the Asylum and Immigration Act. He carried out the crimes between 2008 and 2010. He recruited his victims by offering them jobs as chefs at his hotel. They were told to pay him substantial sums of money which he described as a ""deposit"" in exchange for employment and a salary. On their arrival at the hotel, their wages were reduced to a fraction of the contracted amount and they were required to work far longer hours with their duties extended beyond the kitchen. The men told how they had to paint the hotel, clean rooms and cut and move logs in the hotel grounds in freezing winter temperatures. Arefin threatened his victims with termination of their employment when they complained and refused to return the money they had paid him. In one case the victim described how money lenders in Bangladesh had threatened to remove his kidney as a result of his inability to pay back what he owed. The crimes came to light following an investigation by the UK Border Agency and the then Northern Constabulary. Responding to Arefin's sentencing, Kath Harper, the Crown's national lead prosecutor for human trafficking, said: ""Arefin's greed had life-changing implications not just for his victims, but for their families and others who supported them. ""Human trafficking can come in many forms and as prosecutors we are committed to doing all we can do eradicate it from Scotland."" Kevin Hyland, independent anti-slavery commissioner, added: ""The victims of these particular crimes endured exploitation and abuse many thought was a distant memory of the past. ""This is a clear case of 'modern day slavery' and I commend the bravery of the four men who gave evidence at the trial. I hope that receiving justice in the courts assists in their journey of recovery."" Det Insp Richard Baird from Police Scotland said: ""Shamsul Arefin was driven by financial greed and held no regard for the working conditions of those in his employment. ""This was apparent by the poor condition that his victims were subject to through working long hours at no extra pay and often with substandard equipment and working supplies. ""In bringing this individual to justice we have disrupted, if not dismantled, one more illegal enterprise and hopefully saved other potential victims from inevitable suffering.""",formal

"Editor's note: Ann Curley is the assignment manager for the CNN Medical News unit. She has been a type I diabetic for 40 years. This is her story of life with diabetes. Ann Curley uses a pump attached to a catheter in her body to monitor glucose levels and administer insulin. (CNN) -- When I was 7 years old, my mom took me to the doctor because I had lost a lot of weight, despite a voracious appetite. My family had just moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Pasadena, California, and this visit to the doctor's office was my introduction to a man who would come to have a huge impact on my life. His name was Dr. Robert Deputy, and he was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes. He spoke to me directly, rather than to my mother, and he asked me questions: Did I feel thirsty? Did I need to urinate during the night? The answer to both questions was yes. He asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate. Dr. Deputy told me and my mother that my body wasn't processing sugar properly. I had diabetes. That is how my 40-year journey with diabetes began. I was checked into a hospital to learn how to test my urine for sugar, give myself injections of insulin, follow a diabetic diet and control my diabetes. I spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease, and then they sent me home. Dr. Deputy would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how I was doing. Much to my parents' chagrin -- and to my delight -- he wanted me to be self sufficient and responsible for monitoring myself. I refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine. This demand for self sufficiency turned out to be one of my best life lessons, and not just for managing my diabetes. While some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden, I feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise. It forced our family to eat healthily, and it taught me about good nutrition -- something I practice every day. I know carbohydrate counts in most foods, and I understand dietary concepts that most people don't even care about. Being active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar, so when my urine tested positive for glucose, my older sister Robin was in charge of exercising me. We had countless jump-rope contests, bike rides and roller-skating excursions, keeping me and my three sisters active and fit. And I felt like a little mad scientist, using a test tube with drops of water, urine and fizzy tablets to see if there was sugar in my urine. Fortunately, over time, technology improved. First, test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it. But the truth is, testing urine for sugar was a primitive method. By the time sugar gets into the urine, it's a signal that the body doesn't have enough insulin to process sugar. And the urine test didn't give an actual number for the amount of sugar in the urine. It simply gave a color reading that corresponded with a range of how much sugar was present in the urine. Inaccurate was really an understatement when you talk about urine testing. Home blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s, and they were a huge move toward precise control and management of diabetes. With the kit, the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood. The blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading of the blood glucose within seconds. While I initially balked at the idea of pricking my finger several times a day, now I can't imagine not doing it in order to monitor what my blood sugar is doing. The 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump. This device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin. The reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shunt. So rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the body's insulin patterns, the pump drips insulin into the body to keep blood sugars constant, then gives extra amounts with meals. Another life-altering development in diabetes, which I have discovered in the last year, is the continuous glucose monitor, or CGM. This is a small device inserted into the tissue -- usually the abdomen, hip or leg -- and it has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the body's fluids. The data is transmitted to a receiver, and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels. I have participated in clinical trials for three different CGM devices, and I found them all to be quite accurate. Some sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump, so you can use the reading to adjust and fine-tune the amount of insulin being pumped into the body. The patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated, but it's amazing to be able to see constant readings and graphs of what your blood sugar is doing and better manage blood sugars. CGM technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type I diabetes using what's called a ""closed loop system."" This means diabetics someday will be able to wear a pump that gathers data from a sensor so precise that the pump can be programmed to act on its own and make adjustments all by itself. The current systems are ""open looped,"" meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given. The goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system, and all the patient has to do is wear it. Once that technology is perfected, this type of device would be implanted, which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes. I mentioned to my sister Robin that I had tracked down Dr. Deputy for this article. She told me something I didn't know when I was 7. Forty years ago, before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing, parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare. Dr. Deputy told my parents that I would probably only live to the age of 20 or 30, which apparently -- but not surprisingly -- had the whole family freaked out. I spoke with Dr. Deputy, who recently retired from his pediatric practice, and he seemed to remember me. When I asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival, he said sadly, ""At that time, that was what we told parents back then. ... Everything changes with time -- diabetes, leukemia -- technology has changed with the pump and the equipment."" I think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong. I know that I certainly am. In fact, I am hoping to live another 40 years! E-mail to a friend .",formal

"(Mental Floss) -- Everyone goes through a rebellious phase. And, if you're lucky, you'll be able to look back on those years and laugh. If you're less lucky, you spent those years on a reality show, so for the rest of time, millions of strangers can look back on them and laugh instead. In modern times, cats frolic among the ruins of ancient Rome. But, hey, it could be worse. You could be responsible for the fall of Western Civilization, just like Justa Grata Honoria, the Roman princess whose wild ways and (literally) naked ambition set off a chain reaction that culminated in the destruction of the Roman Empire. Barely regal . Smart, conniving, and ruthless, Honoria possessed all the attributes befitting a Roman emperor, except for that pesky Y chromosome. As a young girl, she watched as her dimwitted six-year-old brother, Valentinian III, was crowned emperor of the Western Roman Empire, while she was set aside to await a suitable marriage. Hardly content to lead a quiet and chaste life, Honoria rebelled with aplomb, sleeping her way through the royal court while still in her teens. Although her after-hours habits caused quite the scandal, they failed to satiate her need for attention and power, so Honoria set her eyes on the throne. Employing her ample charms, she seduced her brother's royal chamberlain, Eugenius, and together, they plotted to murder Valentinian and seize power. But, alas, their scheme was soon exposed. Eugenius was executed, and Honoria was sent to a convent in Constantinople. Life as a nun was a fate worse than death for Honoria, but even that couldn't quell her ambition. She spent her years at the nunnery plotting one escape attempt after another. Finally, out of sheer desperation, she turned to sources outside the empire. Her savior would have to be powerful enough to defy Valentinian and risk open war with Rome. Only one man fit that description: Attila, king of the Huns. Attila the hubby . Honoria got the barbarian's attention with a mutually beneficial proposal: If Attila would rescue her, she would marry him, and he would get half of the Western Empire as her dowry. Of course, Honoria was in no position to rightfully offer any portion of the Roman Empire. But she was betting that after marrying her, Attila would conquer the whole Empire, and she'd become queen to boot. Attila had secretly been planning a move against Rome for years, and Honoria's letter gave him the perfect opportunity to strike. Wasting no time, he told Valentinian that he planned to marry Honoria, and demanded the dowry he'd been promised. Naturally, Valentinian refused, and Attila used his status as a ""wronged husband"" to invade Roman territory in 451 C.E. The Hun armies quickly swept through the Empire, destroying everything in their path, and eventually they arrived in Rome. Like all the other cities before it, Rome would also have been annihilated were it not for the famine and disease that devastated the Huns during the invasion. Rome survived Attila's assault with the unlikely help of another nomadic enemy tribe, the Visigoths, but the Western Empire never recovered. Within a generation, the armies of the Goths, Franks, and Huns had overrun the area. The Princess bride . Ultimately, Honoria became neither Roman empress nor a Hun queen. Attila never rescued her, and she was eventually sent back to Rome and left to her brother's justice. Not wanting to cause a scandal by having her executed, and unwilling to send her back into exile where she could scheme again, Valentinian settled on a suitable third option. After years of struggle, Honoria finally suffered the fate she had been dreading all along: She was married off to an elderly Roman senator, and the rest of her life went unrecorded by history.

"Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks. Attackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said. Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure. The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a ""dongle"" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research. ""That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,"" Mr Newlin said. By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them. The pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15). The attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft). Using this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine. The Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio. Wireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable. Bastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice. Updates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available, But Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.",formal
"I am a little late, but this is something I did that my Dad was proud of me for. I was constantly bullied for around 7 years (still am in some cases) but, although I could fight if I needed to (My father is an ex almost Olympic boxer who taught me for around 2 years,) I would always get ready to hurt someone but stopped myself. I wanted to hurt the person but there was something stopping me. Almost every day I would come home with a new bruise and with each day both my father and I got a little bit more angry, he told me that if I stood up for myself I would get to go to Mc Donalds or something. After years of my Dad telling me to stand up for myself one day while being randomly attacked by someone (he was my friend but just got scared as hell.) So I just did did a spin and threw a right hook (with nice form if I remember correctly,) into his jaw. The bully fell to the ground crying, almost knocked out. As you may expect I got send to the principals office and was told the basic ""What you did was wrong!"" I told my Dad about the story he gave me a pat on my back. When my teacher went to speak with my Dad about it my Dad replied with ""My son was bullied for years and you guys didn't help, he stood up for himself and do you think that that the kid will bully him again?""

"(CNN) -- The man arrested for the videotaped rape of a toddler in Las Vegas, Nevada, will make his initial appearance in court Friday, a Clark County, Nevada, court official told CNN Tuesday. Authorities have not yet decided if Chester Arthur Stiles will appear in person or via video link. The judge will set a date for the arraignment at that hearing. Stiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving. A former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. ""I've had my share of nightmares,"" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace. Thomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a ""weapons enthusiast"" with only a minor criminal record. Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos » . ""How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,"" Thomas said. The judge in the case will hold an administrative hearing Wednesday, but Stiles will not be present, Clark County court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer said. Stiles was already being sought on an unrelated 2004 charge of felony lewdness with a child under 14, Sommermeyer said, adding that authorities amended that earlier filing on October 4 to include 20 counts related to the videotaped rape, including sexual assault and attempted sexual assault. Jerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred. Henderson Police Officer Mike Dye said he pulled over Stiles' car Monday night because it did not have a license plate and became suspicious when the driver gave him an expired California driver's license with a photo that did not look like him. Dye said he and another officer, Mike Gower, questioned Stiles until he admitted his identity. ""He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles. I'm the guy you're looking for,'"" Dye said. ""At that time, he said, 'I'm sick of running.'"" Dye said Stiles was calm and cooperative. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was turned over to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and booked into the jail in Clark County, where he had been sought in connection with the videotape, which shows a girl being sexually assaulted. The girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search. The tape was given to authorities by Darren Tuck, who told police he had found it in the desert five months before handing it over. Because of the delay, during which Tuck allegedly showed the tape to others, he faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography. He turned himself in to authorities in Nye County, Nevada, earlier this month. Professionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was found, and she appears to be ""healthy and fine and happy,"" her mother's attorney said this month. The mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until late last month, Donohue said. ""A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,' "" Donohue said. Donohue said the mother recognized Stiles, a former animal trainer. The alleged abuse most likely occurred while the mother -- a single woman working six days a week -- was at work, Donohue said. Another former girlfriend of Stiles', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is ""mortified"" by the allegations against him. ""He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,"" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim. Todd Allen, Tina Allen's son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.",formal

"DALLAS, Texas (CNN) -- If you turn to the Bible -- Isaiah Chapter 35, Verse 8 -- you will see a passage that in part says, ""A highway shall be there, and a road, and it shall be called the Highway of Holiness."" Churchgoers in six states have held prayer sessions along the side of Interstate 35. Now, is it possible that this ""highway"" mentioned in Chapter 35 is actually Interstate 35 that runs through six U.S. states, from southern Texas to northern Minnesota? Some Christians have faith that is indeed the case. It was with that interesting belief in mind that we decided to head to Texas, the southernmost state in the I-35 corridor, to do a story about a prayer campaign called ""Light the Highway."" Churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside Interstate 35, but the prayers are still continuing. Some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of I-35 being the ""holy"" highway, it needs some intensive prayer first. So we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic Christians prayed on the the interstate's shoulder in Dallas. They chanted loudly and vibrantly, making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on. They prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would ""see the light"" and perhaps close down. They prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate. They prayed that all Americans would accept Jesus into their lives. Watch believers offer prayers » . The woman who came up with the concept of ""Light the Highway"" is a Texas minister named Cindy Jacobs. She says she can't be sure Interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the Bible but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after ""once again reading Isaiah, Chapter 35."" Jacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history, such as the bridge collapse on I-35 in Minneapolis last August and the assassination of JFK 44 years ago near I-35 in Dallas. That's why prayer certainly can't hurt, she adds. Now, it's only fair to say most people, the religious and the non-religious alike, don't buy any of this, but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along I-35. At an adult go-go club, the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others. And he says his club holds fundraisers, food drives and toy drives to help the community. But on the side of the road, the prayerful aren't going to change their minds. Holy highways and nude clubs, they believe, are not a combination God has in mind. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"OK, so back when I was 19, I started working with some guys who sold meat door to door. Every morning, we would load a freezer full of these meat packs into the bed of the pickup truck. Long hours, but every day, lunch was at a different bar. I was underage but with enough guys who weren't and we were low key so nobody questioned that I was there. Anyway, myself and another guy started chatting up our waitresses and we agreed to meet up later when their shift ended. We were in the 'burbs, about 40 miles from downtown/home/office. My friend and I got in his car, and started driving towards the bar. we were early, so I asked him to pull into the nearby store so I could buy some cloves. On the way out, he peels out in the parking lot. This catches a cop's attention. He kicks his lights on and pulls us over. Of course he wants licence, registration, proof of insurance while he lectures my coworker about driving recklessly in a parking lot This is where things start to go sideways. The car is not in his name. His explanation sounds shady to me, even. His license is in order, but I think his insurance has expired... The cop calls for backup, and then 3 or 4 more squad cars arrive, the cops pull us out and ask to search our bodies and the car. I protest, (since I'm kind of drunk and underage) but eventually give in. Coworker does the same. There's a sawed off shotgun in the trunk... serials filed off and shorter than AZ laws permit. In the meantime, 3 more squad cars have arrived, including a K9 SUV and I swear to FSM... A helicopter overhead. By this time, my buzz is totally killed and I figure we're mighty fucked; I can't imagine that they would pour this kind of resource into a stop and NOT arrest us. After all that though, one of the cops comes up and says that the shotgun has to be confiscated; but if we promise to get back in the car and get the hell out of his town, that we were free to go. No explanation was offered and we took off before they could change their minds. We didn't even get a ticket for the original offense. TL;DR Fuck the waitresses, I want my freedom.",informal

"(CNN) -- A bus hopped a highway median and crashed into a pickup truck before being broadsided by an 18-wheeler, Arkansas police said, killing the pickup driver and two bus riders. Two passengers were found dead inside the bus, said Arkansas State Police. Forty people were hurt in Sunday night's crash, which shut down a 13-mile stretch of Interstate-40 east of Forrest City, Arkansas, said state police spokesman Bill Sadler. The bus was westbound en route from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas. The driver of the pickup truck -- identified as 30-year-old Danny Okurily of Hot Springs, Arkansas -- died at the scene of the accident, Sadler said. Bus driver Felix Tapia, 28, of Brownsville, Texas, and tractor-trailer driver David Rice, 45, of Mars Hill, North Carolina, suffered minor injuries, according to The Associated Press. Two passengers were also found dead inside the bus, he said. Their names were not released because authorities have not yet notified relatives, Sadler said. Several dozen injured passengers were taken to hospitals in Forrest City, Memphis and West Memphis, said police. The bus, which listed 44 passengers on its manifest, was owned and operated by the Tornado Bus Line, which is based in Dallas, Texas, Sadler said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Doctors removed five small polyps from President Bush's colon on Saturday, and ""none appeared worrisome,"" a White House spokesman said. The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Bush is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp David. During the procedure Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power. Bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used ""monitored anesthesia care,"" Stanzel said, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic. He spoke to first lady Laura Bush -- who is in Midland, Texas, celebrating her mother's birthday -- before and after the procedure, Stanzel said. Afterward, the president played with his Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, Stanzel said. He planned to have lunch at Camp David and have briefings with National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and planned to take a bicycle ride Saturday afternoon. Cheney, meanwhile, spent the morning at his home on Maryland's eastern shore, reading and playing with his dogs, Stanzel said. Nothing occurred that required him to take official action as president before Bush reclaimed presidential power. The procedure was supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb, Bush's physician, and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, the White House said. Bush's last colonoscopy was in June 2002, and no abnormalities were found, White House spokesman Tony Snow said. The president's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous, according to the Mayo Clinic. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure. Snow said on Friday that Bush had polyps removed during colonoscopies before becoming president. Snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver. Watch Snow talk about Bush's procedure and his own colon cancer » .

"You're 100% correct. To add to this, I'd like to point out that policing cheating via third party software is pretty much the ONLY thing that Blizzard (or any other online game developer) should police. The only exceptions I think would involve harassment (as in spam or real life threats) and other instances in which another player's actions are completely unavoidable to his/her victim. When developers step in to enforce ""fair play"" on players who are completely staying within the confines of the software that the developers themselves put out, you end up with a lot of discrepancies and unjust bans. It's happened countless times, and I'm sure most of you have heard of similar situations where somebody found a quick way to get ahead of other players via legitimate, in-game means, and got banned for it. It's happened on Xbox live, in Guild Wars, and EA is pretty notorious for this as well. If Blizzard adopted similar policies, we'd see people banned for clearing inferno with force armor abuse (release patch), stacking attack speed pre-nerf, using the currently ""OP"" trail of cinders rune, or farming with a WW barb. These are all instances that many people have considered to be unfair advantage exploits, but it's detrimental to the game as a whole to ban players for such innovation. Some of you are probably saying ""well those exploits didn't directly effect other players."" Sure, it's definitely not nice to scam people, but there could be so many things that people would consider to be a scam. If they banned people for trade window scamming, who's to say they shouldn't ban people for things like equipping weak gold find gear in team games, or doing the max bid ""exploit"" that everyone was talking about a few weeks ago. Both of these come at other players' expense, but none of them violate the terms of service. They are unforeseen, specific situations that inevitably arise in any online game and would be impossible to write them all into the EULA. If they were to suddenly ban people for rules that were never outlined, it becomes yet another PR nightmare for them, as well as a (I think) very unethical policy. If Blizzard doesn't want people performing certain actions within the legitimate confines of their software, then they need to take it out on themselves, not the players. By this I mean FIX IT ON THE SOFTWARE END so that players are unable to do this in the first place. Granted, trade window scams are usually avoidable user error, but I also think they could be made safer to use, like they were for the most part in WoW. (Maybe they are by now, I haven't actually used one in awhile). Blizzard is usually pretty good about fixing stuff like this, and I think their philosophy is similar to mine in that scams and exploits should be made impossible (if at all possible) before account bans should even be considered. Lastly, in the case of a possible ""macro"" like OP's situation, whether or not using a macro that allows you to switch an item out of the trade window quickly is an offense worth banning someone for is somewhat debatable. While it is a third party program, it's impact on the game is minimal and avoidable (as seen in the OP's video). It's also difficult to prove because some people might just be able to swap items quickly through practice. OP's video did seem impossibly fast to me, but how would Blizzard be able to fairly gauge how fast is too fast for trade window swapping? Besides, it still kind of goes along with what I've been saying about how player actions shouldn't be banned. Macros are designed to simulate an action that a player can do anyway, just faster. This type of situation can be completely avoided in the future if Blizzard fixes the trade window to lock up for several seconds after any type of item swap is detected. If OP is reading this far, I think your case would have been better accepted had you argued his offense was the use of a third party macro program, not the scam attempt itself. Although I will admit that one Blizzard representative made it quite obvious that they either didn't read your email, or were only allowed to copy+paste a pre-written response. The final response you received seemed more personable and I wouldn't be surprised if it had come from a manager of some sort. It was still somewhat cryptic, but I'm not so sure your message was entirely clear to them, either. TL;DR: Scams and exploits are legitimate game mechanics when not aided by outside software. If developers like Blizzard don't want players performing certain actions in their games, the action should be made impossible within the software rather than unleashing the hordes of oppressive BanMasters into the population. This is exactly what Blizzard is doing, and (to my knowledge) what they've always done, and is what's best for the game.",informal

Last August, McGregor was banned from driving for four months and fined Â£400 after being caught driving at 69mph in a 50mph zone. The court opted to impose a four-month ban instead of a heavier penalty and left him with nine points on his licence. He was convicted at Hamilton Justice of the Peace Court after claiming the speed gun was faulty.

"This reminds me of this gal I met in Atlanta, Georgia. She was cute with emerald eyes, and seemed to be very into me. I decided I would do well with my A-game deployed. All I had to do was be quiet, nod from time to time, and smile occasionally. I know myself very well; when I start talking, the vaginas within earshot tend to dry out like smeared boogers under a computer chair. My methods may seem out of the ordinary, but I have learned to trust and depend on my looks. My soul is ugly, but she won't notice as long as I keep a lid on it. The night goes well and she is all over my arm. I am still quiet and sometimes I have to deftly tuck my dong under my belt to avoid being mistaken as some jerk. We decide her place is where we'll go and off we went. This night my luck would change! We get to her apartment and it smells like testicles after basketball practice. No big deal, at least she had a tidy place. We lay on the couch after putting any movie into the DVD player. Started kissing, and other stuff adults are notorious for. As I am getting some neck, her iguana climbs slowly on to my back. (She lets it roam free; this explains the odor.) ""Oh look! It's Q-Ball!"" She says cheerfully. She grabs him off of my back and his claws scratch me all to hell. ""Uhh. Hello there, Q-Ball..."" I said concealing my irritation. We stop making out and she delivers a lengthy introduction to the huge lizard. I'm pretty sure Q-Ball knows my name, favorite color, and birthday at this point. ""Wanna feed him!?"" she asked enthusiastically. ""Yeah, that'd be cool!"" I replied as genuinely as I could. No one appreciates being cock-blocked by a reptile. It's not like I felt inadequate, I know damn well I can please a woman better than some scaly tree crawler. We fed Q-Ball chunks of squash and that's when she dropped the bomb on me. ""He really likes you. But we can't do anything tonight. Q-Ball has been with me a long time and he's got my six. We should wait and get to know each other better first. I'm sure you understand."" she said. I just shrugged and pecked her on the cheek. ""Of course I understand. I'm glad you have a friend in Q-Ball."" I said rather convincingly. We've been dating for a few months now and just last night I finally got to seal the deal with her. She was amazing in bed! But she insisted Q-Ball had to watch us because she couldn't get aroused unless she knew she was safe. If that girl ever cheats on me, it will be with Q-Ball, I just know it.

"After seeing enough of these pre and post weight loss photos, I've decided I'll dedicate my senior thesis in scientific research to this phenomenon I'm going to call *The Chubby Muncher*. I established that every person that is overweight, from a little chubbiness to a lot of fat lady lobes covering the body, in every segment of being a fatty, is capable of eating a smaller, handsome person. Whether or not it shows depends on the size of the smaller, handsome person and the digestion process of the fat person. When they munch it down, the smaller person has a 1/32 chance of still being alive. In other cases, the fat person remains fat forever, but can still munch down other smaller people that will reset the 1/32 chance for them. In the rare case that the smaller person survives, they can, in turn, start eating up the conscience of the fat person from within. This is a 100% deliberate choice. If the smaller person decided they like being inside the big person, they can tingle their brains and ask for more candy, and the fat person will inject more sugars into their body, for the smaller person to eat. They have to survive too, you know. But if the smaller person decides they want out and start eating the conscience, at one point, the rest of the triggers will stop working. The fat person will stop eating so much and so unhealthy, the fat person's muscles will demand exercise and eventually, the fat person is completely obliterated and the smaller, handsome person comes out. **TL;DR** don't be fooled! This is not the fat person from the first photo! It is a smaller, handsome person the fat person had at first eaten, but fought its way out!",informal

"(InStyle.com) -- A hit TV show. An Emmy. A summer blockbuster. A new company. A wedding! Katherine Heigl has every reason to smile for our camera. A star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born. The Ingénue: ""This is my favorite look of the three just because it's sexy but not overtly so,"" Heigl says. ""I like simple hair and makeup."" There has been a self-tanning mishap . As Katherine Heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late. Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fiancé, musician Josh Kelley, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work). So here she is, in a strapless, ankle-length Juicy Couture sundress (donned to accommodate the residual stickiness), fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when (or if) the lotion ever sets. Not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products. ""I love everything new,"" says Heigl, 28, who, in addition to being nominated for an Emmy for best supporting actress on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" just started a production company at Fox. ""When I was in Rhode Island filming this summer, I went to Sephora for the first time. It was like my holy mecca."" She recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high counter to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well-organized loot. Then there's her deal with Coty to be the face of Nautica's new women's fragrance in January. Considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as Heigl's impressive acting range -- she plays TV dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy, as in the mega-hit ""Knocked Up"" and next year's 27 Dresses -- it seems natural for her to be In Style's first ever triple-cover girl. These three looks take her from girl-next-door to red-carpet knockout to pixie-coiffed vamp. The star, whom pals call Katie (and Hollywood calls the Next Big Thing), popped out her retainer to talk about makeup, breakouts and what boys like. KATHERINE HEIGL: I'm so sorry, I have to take out my Invisalign before I eat. IN STYLE: Who knew you wore them? I guess that's the point of Invisalign. KH: I got them because of this wonky tooth. I was like, OK, I can't take it. It's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer. Pretty much the perfect way to describe Invisalign is Netflix for your teeth. IS: Right -- the things we do for beauty. So, how did you like being transformed into three such different looks? KH: It was fun. I was working with such great hair and makeup people. And to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat. IS: Do you ever go without makeup? KH: There was a time when I would. Now that I get followed by photographers, I'm really paranoid about it. I do not want to be the ""Look What This Celebrity Looks Like Without Makeup"" picture. I'm clearly vain, and I don't need that. Plus, I like products. IS: How often do you go through your drawers and purge? KH: Often, because people send me a lot of stuff now, which is exciting. I love getting those boxes. [Into the tape recorder:] Send me a box of makeup, Stila! When that happens, I feel like I have to clean out and give stuff to my sister, mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that I can't accept. IS: How do you think you express your personality through style? KH: I'm a big hair-up person. Last night at work they put my hair in two French braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap. I thought it looked cute and that I could pull it off after I'd slept on it. And ... no. So I thought I could recreate it myself ... no again. As far as clothing style goes, I fluctuate almost as much as I do with beauty products. I like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it's the New Englander in me. I'm building a house in the mountains in Utah, so I tell myself I'm ""preparing"" for that. I like sweaters -- they're like scrubs -- you don't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat. IS: Do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding? KH: I have an idea, but it's so dependent on the dress, and I haven't gotten there yet. My sister is getting married too, so we looked for dresses together. After about five stores I was like, ""I'm done."" Everyone says, ""You just know when you put that dress on."" My sister found the right dress just like that. So I know it can happen. But it's grueling. IS: Wait, so your mom has two daughters getting married within months? KH: My poor mother is probably like, ""Why, God? Why?"" But I hired a planner. I want the day to be spectacular, but mostly I want it to be fun. And I don't want to freak out or stress. IS: Does your fiancé have any particular opinions about your look? KH: Josh wouldn't mind if my hair was brown, if it was still long -- that's such a boy thing. IS: Would you ever wear a wig out? KH: I'd contemplate it, but I don't know if I actually have the courage to pull it off. I once wore a long hair-extension ponytail, and someone asked me if it was real, like I was one of those dolls when we were little, and the hair just cranks out. IS: How would you describe your skin? KH: My skin is sensitive, so everything bothers it. And I'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse. IS: How do you treat a breakout? KH: I got a great product at Ona Spa called Sebuspot. I've tried so many that were disappointments, but maybe I stand too close to the mirror examining my pores. If I backed up, things might look fine. IS: What do you always carry in your bag? KH: Powder, because I get shiny. And lip balm, either the Smith's Rosebud Salve or C.O. Bigelow's Mentha Lip Shine in Black Cherry Soda from Bath & Body Works. It's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good. IS: An In Style.com reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in Hollywood. KH: I train with Harley Pasternak. I love him with my whole soul and follow his 5-Factor diet. I first said, ""I'm never going to be -- nor do I want to be -- an uber-athletic girl."" It's just not me and I don't have that kind of discipline. He said, ""I just want you to be healthy."" A lot of what we focus on is posture. I slump into myself when I get stressed. If I were going to play an action hero, I'd have to get that look. But I'd never maintain it. For me it's never about achieving a look that's impossible. E-mail to a friend . Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2007 Time Inc. All rights reserved.",formal
Backstory: This F250 has been in my family since i can even literally remember. One day on the way home (Nebraska) from Oklahoma we were pulling a trailer and see smoke from the under the hood. So we jump out and pop the hood and low and behold the damn things on fire. Luckily we were at a rest stop and a couple truckers had extinguishers. But it was too late much of the truck had been burned. Come to find out a fuel line had broken. Well it was the only truck we had at the time that could pull and money was tight so we replaced the interior and got her running right and continued to use it. About a year later my father and I were changing the oil and hear a clank in the drain pan. I looked through and to my amazement was piece of the piston skirt. So the truck got parked and the family got a new one. Several years later i decided i missed it and sanded it down and painted it white. Took the motor out and replaced it with a fresh one i built myself. Now its as happy as can be with no rust and a healthy 460. Its basically a toy that i take out in the backwoods with friends now since it doesnt go too far at 5-6mpg. TL;DR Truck caught fire then later found pieces of piston in oil and pan.

"I sort of have 2, The 1st being this - I've always doubted an existence of God but always flirted with the idea of religion... Mostly due to the fact that people would talk to me and the idea of a God that loves me when pretty much no else has is appealing. But I'm sure as hell not religious and I'm defiantly closer to the atheist side then the Christian... But what if we're wrong? I sure as hell know I've messed up much easier questions then eternal life/damnation and suffering. Number 2 being - I grew up in a pretty fucked up house. Abuse, neglect, parents who hated each other but stayed together to help me (Don't do it, it doesn't do jack shit other then make your kid miserable) and I got kicked out of schools pretty much everywhere. This all led to me not having friends like at all. Ever. I never stayed in a school more then a year until high school. My freshman year, I had a theater class that I got stuck in because everything was full. We were assigned partners and pretty much the whole class was spent with them. What do you know I get paired with the sweetest, smartest, most attractive girl I've ever met in my life (Ok she's not the most attractive looking back, But she was a looker). The first few weeks are awkward as hell, as you might imagine. But eventually we start talking and we bonded. Like super bonded. Like we were inseparable for most of high school. She took so much shit over talking to me, but it never stopped her. After 2 or so years, I finally worked up the confidence to ask her out. I planned and I planned, I picked a date, I knew exactly what I was going to say and I set out for her house with determination. I bought flowers and everything. I get to her house and let myself in (Best friends and I have an abusive family, I spent more time there then I did at my house) and walk up to her room. I turn the corner to go in and there she is kissing some guy. Ofc I'm crushed so I high tail it the hell out of dodge. Never said a word about it, and she never found it. Later on she introduced me and I ofc had to pretend it was the best thing ever. But this guy was a class A fuckhead. (Why are women attracted to that... Someone explain that) I hated him from the start, but tried to support her. Worst mistake I ever made. About four months after I found out, He drugged and raped her.

"(CNN) -- Nasser al Ansari is the CEO of Qatari Diar, a state-owned real estate investment company. Famous for its purchase of London's Chelsea Barracks, Qatari Diar was established in 2004 by the Qatar Investment Authority, to support Qatar's growing economy and to co-ordinate the country's real estate development priorities. It is now valued at $1 billion with 18 projects underway. Al Ansari is a graduate from the University of Miami and was responsible for high profile projects such as New Doha International Airport and the promotion of private sector investment through public sector privatization. Before being appointed as CEO of Qatari Diar, Al Ansari was at the office of the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs as technical advisor. He joins us on MME to talk about the vision for Qatar, how Qatari Diar fits into it and its investments outside Gulf in Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Egypt and Europe. With oil prices hitting $88 this week, John Defterios begins by asking Nasser al Ansari about the differences he sees now compared to the 1970s when oil prices were also high. Any lessons learned? Nasser al Ansari: I believe so. In the 1970s, local government here did not deal in a very sophisticated way with this wealth. But now we are fortunate with a high level of education and the reformations in government policies in this region. We now understand how to utilize this wealth and economical growth. JD: I don't think most people know that you sit on one of the largest natural gas fields in the world and will likely be the largest exporter by 2010. This must give you great cushion to expand the Qatari Diar model. NA: Although we have this and we are fortunate with this, Qatar has adopted a policy to diversify its portfolio from its natural resources to other investment opportunities and one of them is Qatari Diar. We are investing a lot in real estate, not just in Qatar but worldwide. JD: In fact very close in the neighborhood as well. It's almost foreign policy strategy to invest in the poorer countries in the region. Is this to help the neighborhood develop alongside Qatar? NA: I think with the knowledge and know-how that we have gained in this area of expertise, we would like to export it to other countries to help their economical reformations; to try to create business opportunities for their local businessmen and to create job opportunities for the people in that particular country. JD: It's quite a radical departure say from the International Monetary Fund or World Bank giving loans or grants for development. This is turning the world upside down in your region, it is not? NA: Yes, I would like to assure you at Qatari Diar we are not in the business of lending. JD: You want a hard return. NA: We want return but we always think of the people when we are investing in these countries. I mean we want to make sure that the investment we are making is there for the long-term. Qatari Diar has a policy: it's a long-term policy not short-term. JD: Give me some insight on why Qatari Diar feels as comfortable in London with Chelsea Barracks as in Cuba, for example, with some of the projects you're undertaking. What makes you think you can pull that off? NA: I think with the expertise that we have and with the strength that we have, we would like to showcase the strength of the people of Qatar and we want to pull the flag of the state of Qatar even across the Atlantic and we are determined to do so. We are a small country but with big ideas. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- More than 100 homes in an upscale San Diego community were evacuated after a landslide about 60 yards wide pulled the earth from beneath a three-lane road and some of the multimillion-dollar homes that adorn it. Gina Yarbrough sent this picture of the road that collapsed in Wednesday's landslide. Mayor Jerry Sanders declared a state of emergency, asking California and the federal government to help the La Jolla community recover from the Wednesday landslide. As of Thursday morning, he had already received offers of aid from legislators, the governor's office and the White House, he said. Officials warned for at least two weeks that the ground was shifting beneath the hillside community along Soledad Mountain Road. Holes were drilled into the unsettled hillside to investigate the cause and magnitude of the shift, which earlier ruptured a water line, and according to some media reports, began cracking Soledad Mountain Road in July. On Wednesday, a 20-foot-deep chasm opened beneath the road and homes. Holli Weld told San Diego's KGTV that she was walking her son to preschool when the street collapsed. Watch a resident recall how he had to grab his dogs and run » . ""The street was sinking before our eyes,"" she said. Authorities told KGTV that most residents were at work and only seven people were in their homes when the landslide occurred. Evacuated homeowner Russell Moore told CNN he remembers hearing the earth ""groan"" in what he called a ""slow avalanche."" ""The asphalt that should be under my feet was 8 feet in the air,"" Moore said. ""We watched the trees snapping and cracking and more boulders come down to our feet and we were witnessing this move."" See photos of the hole the landslide left in La Jolla » . At least 111 homes were evacuated, but Sanders said residents would be allowed to return to 75 of those houses by early Thursday morning. Several homes were damaged and at least one was destroyed, according to media reports. Nine homes are ""red tagged,"" meaning no one is allowed to enter them, and 27 more are ""yellow tagged,"" which means residents can return for necessities, but cannot stay, Sanders said. According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, the landslide downed power lines and caused a minor gas leak. More than 2,400 customers were briefly left without electricity, but most residents had their power restored by Thursday, KGTV reported. The Red Cross opened a shelter at La Jolla High School. Deputy city engineer Robert Hawk told the Union-Tribune that the hillside has slowly been slipping for years because the soil is unstable. Landslide incidents in the neighborhood date back to the 1960s, Hawk told the newspaper. Pat Abbott, a retired geological sciences professor at San Diego State University, told the Union-Tribune that Mount Soledad is made up of weak layers of rock and that the culprit in the landslide is nature. ""Gravity pulling on the incline is pulling down masses of earth and those masses of earth have houses on top of them,"" Abbott told the paper. ""It's a geologically bad site and should not have been built on to begin with."" E-mail to a friend .",formal

"Tower of heaven wasn't great mainly because it was the last arc to feature the bad reused animations for attacks and such, and the lack of blood that becomes a real mood killer when Erza has her first real major battles that would need it. Oracion Seis on the other hand was just a huge let down on delivering the story. The thing is my opinion on this arc might be a little biased, as at this point I ran out of episodes and changed to reading the manga. Then when coming back to watch the episodes it was more evident what factors were missing from the anime and that affected my views on the series. Now obviously it had its moments, Jura's fight with Hoteye was very well made, but especially the fights on the later stages seemed much worse on anime format. Lucy's and Erza's fights were not that well done and the final fight was made a wee bit too corny compared to the manga. But the real killer was the fact that the anime's delivery of the emotional stuff at the end was just plain worse than the manga's. That could be because I had already known of the coming plot twists, but that hasn't really mattered in any other anime I've watched thus far, nor did it affect my reactions in the Edolas scenes, which in truth were not as sad as the one in the end of Oracion Seis. **TL;DR:** A mix of censoring, lacking delivery and bias towards the manga.",informal

"Resuming on 33-1, Machan (81) and Wells put on 134 for the second-wicket before Machan was bowled by Ravi Patel (4-42). Wells fell to Patel shortly after for 61, but Yardy's innings of 70 at Lord's helped the visitors up to 300 all out - a first innings lead of 66. At stumps, Middlesex were 47-0, with Sam Robson racing to 41 not out, trailing by 19 runs. A worn-looking pitch made Machan's fine knock all the more impressive, with Yardy and Wells taking a more workmanlike approach to their innings. Patel was not introduced to the Middlesex bowling attacking until 150 runs were on the board but in just his second over he removed Machan, going on to add Wells, Chris Nash and Ben Brown. Just as the home side were threatening to take control at 216-6, a Sussex fight back began, with Ashar Zaidi putting on 38 with Yardy, followed by a useful 40 from Yardy and Ollie Robinson. James Harris finished off the Sussex tail with the wickets of Yardy and Chris Liddle in three balls, leaving the match finely balanced, and allowing Middlesex's batsmen to make vital ground before stumps.",formal

(2) Whereas at its meeting on 29 October 1990 the Council set an objective of stabilizing total CO2 emissions by the year 2000 at the 1990 level in the Community as a whole; (3) Whereas Decision 93/389/EEC (5) established a monitoring mechanism of Community CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions; (4) Whereas nonetheless, despite efforts made, CO2 emissions in the Community generated by energy consumption are expected to increase by 5 to 8 % between 1995 and 2000, assuming normal economical growth; whereas, therefore, additional measures are indispensable; (5) Whereas the Commission, in its communication of 8 February 1990 on energy and the environment, highlighted energy efficiency as the cornerstone of future efforts to reduce the negative impact of energy on the environment; (6) Whereas improvement in the management of energy is urgently needed in order to contribute to the protection of the environment, to a better security of energy supply and to sustainable development; (7) Whereas the Commission has communicated to the Council and the European Parliament, by means of the Green paper of 11 January 1995 and the White Paper of 13 December 1995, its views on the future of energy policy in the Community, and the role of energy-saving and energy efficiency measures;

whereas energy should be integrated into that effort; (9) Whereas, by Decision 91/565/EEC (6), a Community energy efficiency programme (SAVE), aimed at strengthening energy efficiency infrastructures within the Community, was adopted; whereas that programme expired on 31 December 1995; (10) Whereas the Community recognized the SAVE programme as an important element of the Community's CO2 reduction strategy; whereas the communication of the Commission of 8 May 1991 on the European Community's energy programming activities at regional level, the conclusion of the Council on this communication, and the Resolution of the European Parliament of 16 July 1993 (7) stated that those activities should be pursued, amplified and utilized as a support for the energy strategy of the Community; whereas this initiative for regional actions should now be totally incorporated into a new SAVE II programme; (11) Whereas by Decision No 1110/94/EC on the European Parliament and of the Council (8), a fourth framework programme for actions in technological research, development and demonstration was established; whereas energy efficiency policy constitutes an important instrument for the use and promotion of the new energy technologies that the framework programme will establish; whereas the SAVE II programme represents a policy instrument which complements this programme;

"Yes, but I feel in this case they are separate entities. Civcraft is a game. The game starts, and the game ends. The character dies, the player moves on. Everyone plays Civcraft for different reasons, but some people wish to learn. For me the most intelligent option was to choose a different character so I may experience a different reality within this game. A reality that happens to effect others in ways which they perceive as negative. So this ""victim"" of my actions, how do they choose to feel about me? Do they resent the character portrayed, or the person who chooses to portray them? Do they keep these resentments when the game ends and a new one begins? There is a risk factor that happens when you step into Civcraft, you're stepping into an experiment, you don't know whats going to happen. I personally feel that when I, or any one carries forth with an action some perceive to be negative, there is truly no harm being done. The only harm that any ""Real Person"" receives is that which he allows himself to receive, at least in CivCraft. This isn't really a clean issue though, right now I feel that most interaction taking place right now is between players, and not so much between characters. Especially when you hold a player accountable on the same level as the character for the actions of a character. TL;DR Always pick GI Joe, cause apparently when you pick Cobra, you aren't worthy of cookies at snack time.",informal
"ROME, Italy -- Mauro Camoranesi scored with 13 minutes left to earn Juventus a 1-1 home draw with Serie A leaders Inter Milan on Sunday. Julio Cruz is mobbed by team-mates after giving Inter the lead in their 1-1 draw at Juventus. Camoranesi picked up a headed knock-down from substitute Vincenzo Iaquinta before seeing his shot deflect off defender Walter Samuel to leave goalkeeper Julio Cesar helpless. Inter took a first-half lead when Argentine striker Julio Cruz broke Juve's offside trap and latched onto Brazilian midfielder Cesar's through ball before firing past Gianluigi Buffon. The result means Inter retain their unbeaten record this season, despite injury problems that saw the likes of Patrick Vieira, Francesco Toldo, Marco Materazzi and Dejan Stankovic ruled out. The defending champions are now two points clear of Fiorentina at the top of the table, with Roma a point further behind and Juventus in fourth place. Earlier in the day, Roma missed out on the chance to close the gap on Inter when a late collapse saw them throw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Empoli. First half goals from French winger Ludovic Giuly and Matteo Brighi had put the visiting Romans in charge and for more than an hour they looked set to cruise to victory. But with 23 minutes remaining Ighli Vannucchi reduced the deficit and Sebastian Giovinco snatched an injury time equaliser to deny Luciano Spaletti's injury-depleted team. Siena snatched a share of the spoils from Parma in a 2-2 draw as Daniele Galloppa scored in the last minute while Napoli needed an injury time goal from striker Ezequiel Lavezzi to deny rock-bottom Reggina their first win of the season, forcing them to settle for a 1-1 draw in the south.

"Commission Decision of 17 July 2003 extending the period referred to in Article 95(6) of the EC Treaty in relation to the national provisions on the use of short-chain chlorinated paraffins notified by the Netherlands under Article 95(4) (notified under document number C(2003) 2539) (Only the Dutch text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2003/549/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95(6) thereof, Whereas: I. FACTS (1) By letter of the Office of the Permanent Representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the European Union of 17 January 2003, the Dutch Government, referring to Article 95(4) of the Treaty, notified to the Commission its national provisions on the use of Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (hereinafter referred to as SCCPs) that it deems necessary to maintain after the adoption of European Parliament and Council Directive 2002/45/EC of 25 June 2002 amending for the 20th time Council Directive 76/769/EEC(1). 1. Article 95(4) and (6) of the Treaty (2) Article 95(4) and (6) of the Treaty provides: ""4. If, after the adoption by the Council or by the Commission of a harmonisation measure, a Member State deems it necessary to maintain national provisions on grounds of major needs referred to in Article 30, or relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment, it shall notify the Commission of these provisions as well as the grounds for maintaining them. (...) 6. The Commission shall, within six months of the notification approve or reject the national provisions involved after having verified whether or not they are a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction to trade between Member States and whether or not they shall constitute an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market In the absence of a Decision by the Commission within this period the national provisions referred to in paragraphs 4 (...) shall be deemed to have been approved. When justified by the complexity of the matter and in the absence of danger for human health, the Commission may notify the Member State concerned that the period referred to in this paragraph may be extended for a further period of up to six months."" 2. Directive 2002/45/EC (3) Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations(2), as amended, establishes rules restricting the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations. According to Article 1(1), the Directive applies to the dangerous substances and preparations listed in Annex I. (4) Article 2 provides that Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the dangerous substances and preparations listed in Annex I may only be placed on the market or used subject to the conditions specified therein. (5) Directive 76/769/EEC has been amended on several occasions, inter alia, to add new dangerous substances and preparations to Annex I thereto, thereby introducing the restrictions on their marketing or use that are necessary to protect human health or the environment. (6) Adopted on the legal basis of Article 95 of the Treaty, European Parliament and Council Directive 2002/45/EC has inserted in Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC a new point 42 concerning Alkanes, C10-C13, chloro (SCCPs), laying down rules on the marketing and use of these substances. (7) Recital 1 of the Directive states that ""limitations already adopted or planned by certain Member States on the use of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) following PARCOM (Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources) Decision 95/1 directly affect the completion and functioning of the internal market; it is therefore necessary to approximate the laws of the Member States in this field and consequently to amend Annex I to Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations taking into account Community risk-assessments and the relevant scientific evidence in support of PARCOM Decision 95/1"". (8) Recitals 2 and 3 recall the background to the Directive, stating that ""SCCPs are classified as dangerous to the environment, since they are very toxic to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment"" and that ""the Commission has adopted a Recommendation, in the framework of Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 of 23 March 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances(3), calling for specific measures to restrict the use of SCCPs, in particular in metalworking fluids and leather finishing products, in order to protect the aquatic environment"" respectively. (9) According to point 42.1, SCCPs may not be placed on the market for use as substances or as constituents of other substances or preparations in concentrations higher than 1 %: - in metalworking, - for fat liquoring of leather. (10) Point 42.2 provides that before 1 January 2003 all remaining uses of SCCPs will be reviewed by the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and the OSPAR Commission, in the light of any relevant new scientific data on risks posed by SCCPs to health and the environment and that the European Parliament will be informed of the outcome of this review. (11) Article 2(1) provides that Member States shall adopt and publish, not later than 6 of July 2003, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive and that they shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof and that they shall apply those measures from 6 January 2004 at the latest. 3. National provisions (12) The national provisions notified by the Netherlands were introduced by Decision of 3 November 1999, laying down rules prohibiting certain uses of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (Chlorinated Paraffins Decision, Chemicals Substances Act (WMS)) (Staatsblad van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, Jaargang 1999, 478). (13) Article 1 provides that the Decision applies to chlorinated alkanes with a chain of from 10 to 13 inclusive carbon atoms and a chlorination degree of not less than 48 % by weight. Under Article 2(1), SCCPs referred to in Article 1 may not be used: - as plasticisers in paints, coatings or sealants, - in metal-working fluids, - as flame-retardant in rubber, plastics or textiles. However, under Article 2(2) SCCPs may continue to be used until 31 December 2004 in dam sealants or as flame-retardants in conveyor belts for exclusive use in mining. (14) These provisions were notified to the Commission at the draft stage on 8 March 1999 under Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998, laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations(4). The Netherlands pointed out that the introduction of the envisaged provisions was necessary in order for it to comply with its international obligations under the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources (the ""Paris Convention"") and the Paris Commission (PARCOM) Decision 95/1 of June 1995 on the Phasing out of SCCPs taken in implementation thereof, to which the Kingdom of the Netherlands is Contracting Party(5). Five Member States(6) and the European Commission issued observations, whereas Spain issued a detailed opinion. All these Member States except Denmark and Austria opposed the introduction of the envisaged national provisions and so did the European Commission. 4. Background information on SCCPs (15) Chlorinated paraffins are chemical substances manufactured from the chlorination of straight chain paraffins or alkanes. They are often divided into several groups depending on the chain length of the starting material and the amount of chlorine in the final product. Three major groups are short, medium and long chained chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs, MCCPs and LCCPs, respectively). SCCPs are manufactured from straight chain paraffins of chain length C 10 to C 13. The commercial SCCPs can contain between 49 and 71 % chlorine as an average. They can be marketed and used in their pure form but they can also be present as impurities in other substances and preparations, especially MCCPs(7). (16) In the European Community SCCPs are mainly used as additives in metal working fluids. Other uses are as flame-retardants in rubber formulations and as additives for paints and other coating systems. Minor uses are as fattening and softening agents in the leather industry, impregnation agents in the textiles industry and as additives for sealing compounds. (17) SCCPs are classified as dangerous substances under Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances(8). In particular, they are classified as carcinogens, category 3, and are labelled with the risk phrase R 40 (Possible risk of irreversible effects) and the symbol Xn (harmful). They are also classified as dangerous for the environment and are labelled with the risk phrase R 50/53 (""very toxic to aquatic organisms"" and ""may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment"") and the symbol N (""dangerous for the environment""). (18) Due to their toxicity and their apparent persistence and tendency to bioaccumulation, SCCPs are among the substances for which measures aimed at combating pollution are envisaged under the Paris Convention (now OSPAR Convention)(9). During the early 1990s, the Paris commission expressed a concern over the emissions of SCCPs to the marine environment and started to consider regulatory measures on the use of these substances. At that time, the European producers submitted a proposal for a voluntary agreement with a view to phasing out the supply of SCCPs intended for metal working fluids applications and encouraging the downstream industry to use products less damaging to the aquatic environment. The negotiations were not successful and the Paris Commission (PARCOM) finally adopted Decision 95/1. The United Kingdom opposed this Decision pointing out that it was not supported by an appropriate assessment of the risks. (19) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/94(10), SCCPs were included in the first list of priority substances to be subjected to risk evaluation under Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 of 23 March 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances(11), with the United Kingdom acting as rapporteur. (20) The risk assessment report produced by the United Kingdom was submitted to the Member States' Technical Experts(12) for review. Finalised in September 1997, the report(13), which considered all scientific evidence available until 1996, including that on which PARCOM Decision 95/1 was based, highlighted certain environmental risks to aquatic organisms from the use of SCCPs in metalworking and leather finishing, for which it suggested that risk reduction measures should be considered. The remaining current uses were not considered to raise a concern for both the aquatic environment and human health, although further information and testing were considered to be needed to adequately characterise certain possible environmental risks from the use of SCCPs in rubber. (21) The risk assessment report was subsequently submitted to the CSTEE ( Scientific Committee on Toxicity Ecotoxicity and the Environment) for peer-review. In its Opinion of 27 November 1998(14), the CSTEE confirmed the scientific validity of the results of the risk assessment. Those results and the corresponding risk reduction strategy were finally adopted at Community level through Commission Recommendation 1999/721/EC of 12 October 1999 under Regulation (EEC) No 793/93. The relevant parts of the Recommendation are reproduced below. ""I. RISK ASSESSMENT A. Human health The conclusion of the evaluation of the risks to man for WORKERS, CONSUMERS and MAN EXPOSED VIA THE ENVIRONMENT is that there is at present no need for further information and/or testing or for risk reduction measures beyond those which are being applied. This conclusion is reached because: - the risk assessment shows that risks related to the population mentioned above are not expected. The main route of potential worker exposure during production and use is via dermal exposure. Inhalation is also a potential route of exposure during use of metal working fluids and hot-melt adhesives containing the substance. Risk reduction measures already being applied in the framework of the workplace or other relevant Community legislation in force are considered sufficient, - Consumer exposure, which may occur by contact with leather goods treated with the substance and from non-professional use of metal working fluids, was considered not to be of concern. B. Environment The conclusion of the evaluation of the risks to the environment for AQUATIC (sediment) and TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM is that there is a need for further information and/or testing. This conclusion is reached because: - there is a need for better information to adequately characterise the risk to sediment compartment arising from production of the substance and its use in rubber, to the soil and sediment compartments arising from the formulation and use of metal working fluids and leather finishing products, and to the soil and sediment compartments at regional level. The information requirements are: - experimental determination of the Koc(15), - monitoring data in soil and sediment near sources of release, - toxicity testing on soil and sediment dwelling organisms if the above mentioned information does not remove the concern for the above mentioned compartments. The conclusion of the evaluation of the risks to the environment for MICRO-ORGANISMS in the SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT and ATMOSPHERE is that there is at present no need for further information and/or testing or for risk reduction measures beyond those which are being applied. This conclusion is reached because: - the risk assessment shows that risks related to the environmental spheres mentioned above are not expected. Risk reduction measures already being applied are considered sufficient. The conclusion of the evaluation of the risks to the environment for AQUATIC (excluding sediment) ECOSYSTEM and NON-COMPARTMENT SPECIFIC EFFECTS RELEVANT TO THE FOOD CHAIN is that there is a need for specific measures to limit the risks. This conclusion is reached because of: - concerns for effects on the local aquatic environmental spheres mentioned above as a consequence of exposure arising from formulation and use of metal working fluids containing the substance and leather finishing products containing the substance, - concerns for non-compartmental specific effects relevant to the food chain arising from the formulation and use of leather finishing products containing the substance and from use of metal working fluids containing the substance. II. STRATEGY FOR LIMITING RISKS for the ENVIRONMENT Marketing and use restrictions should be considered at Community level for the substance to protect the environment from the use and formulation of products, in particular for use in metal working and leather finishing. Further work is necessary to establish those uses for which derogations can be justified. The measures identified to protect the environment will also reduce human exposure."" (22) On 20 June 2000 the Commission adopted a proposal for an amendment of Directive 76/769/EC with a view to introducing the marketing and use restrictions suggested by the Community risk assessment, which finally led to the adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of Directive 2002/45/EC. (23) As required by point 42.2 of Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC, as introduced by Directive 2002/45/EC, the Commission started the review of the remaining uses of SCCPs. In this context, the Commission requested the United Kingdom, as Member State rapporteur for the risk assessment of SCCPs in the framework of Regulation 793/93/EC, to gather and review all new relevant available data and, if appropriate, to update the Community risk assessment report. Furthermore, the Commission asked the OSPAR Secretariat whether there were any new scientific data on risks posed by SCCPS which might modify the conclusions of the previous risk assessment. The Commission finally asked the CSTEE whether the latter was aware of any new available scientific evidence which could influence the results of the risk assessment and might call for a modification of its conclusions. (24) In its opinion of 22 December 2002, the CSTEE concluded that the review of new knowledge on SCCPs does not highlight any need to change the conclusions of the Community risk assessment(16). (25) In February 2003, the United Kingdom produced a draft updated risk assessment report on SCCPs as a follow up to Directive 2002/45/EC. The draft report reviews the data on the environmental exposure, fate and effects of SCCPs that have become available since the original risk assessment was completed and re-assesses the risks from the uses other than those subject to the marketing and use restrictions laid down in Directive 2002/45/EC. The two opinions of the CSTEE referred to above (points 21 and 24) have also been considered. By contrast to the original risk assessment, the new draft updated risk assessment covers the risks to the marine environment and considers in detail the emissions of SCCPs over the lifetime of products containing them. (26) The results of the draft updated draft risk assessment are reproduced below: ""(x) i) There is a need for further information and/or testing. For surface water, sediment, soil and secondary poisoning, as well as marine ecosystems, there is a need for further specific exposure information, in order to refine the release estimates for the local (rubber, paints/coatings and textiles) and regional (all uses) scenarios. In particular, information could be provided on: - actual releases from the compounding and conversion of rubber, - the amounts of short-chain chlorinated paraffins used at typical textile compounding (formulation) and backcoating sites, - releases from textile compounding and backcoating sites, - releases from paint formulation and application sites, and - emissions during use and disposal of products. The substance meets the screening criteria for consideration as a PBT substance, and so a simulation test for biodegradability could also be performed to determine the half-life in the marine environment. Additional toxicity data would allow the PNEC for both marine water and sediment to be revised, but the need to gather such data is less important than the determination of persistence. In addition, consideration could be given to carrying out further biodegradation testing of short-chain chlorinated paraffins in soil. NOTE: Measurements indicate that the substance is widely distributed in the environment. The trend in levels is unknown, and they could be related to former uses that are now controlled. In addition, a clear risk has not been identified on the basis of these measurements. Nevertheless, the occurrence of short-chain chlorinated paraffins in the Arctic and marine predators mean that these findings remain a concern. Whilst it is not possible to say whether or not on a scientific basis there is a current or future risk to the environment, in light of: - data indicating presence in biota, - the apparent persistence of the substance (based on laboratory tests), - the time it would take to gather the information, and - the fact that it could be difficult to reduce exposure if the additional information confirmed a risk, consideration could be given at a policy level about the need to investigate precautionary risk management options now in the absence of measured environmental half-life data, to reduce the inputs to water (and soil from the application of sewage sludge), including from 'waste remaining in the environment'. This could be reconsidered should an environmental simulation test show that the persistence criterion is not fulfilled. In connection with this, it should be noted that the substance appears to meet the screening criteria for consideration as a candidate persistent organic pollutant (POP) under international conventions. (x) ii) There is at present no need for further information and/or testing or for risk reduction measures beyond those that are being applied already. This conclusion applies to the assessment of: - the local surface water compartment for production sites, formulation and use of sealants, the formulation and use of paints and coatings, and at the regional level, - the local sediment compartment for production sites, formulation and use of sealants, the formulation and use of paints and coatings, and at the regional level, - the assessment of waste water treatment plants from all uses, - the atmospheric compartment and wastewater treatment processes for production and all uses, - the local terrestrial compartment for production sites and formulation and use of sealants and formulation and use of paints, and the regional agricultural soil compartment, and - secondary poisoning for use of sealants."" (27) In addition to the Community measures referred to above, SCCPs are considered by other Community legislation. In view of their human toxicity and aquatic toxicity, of their widely detected presence in the aquatic environment and of the fact that they are already subject to PARCOM Decision 95/1, SCCPs were included by Decision 2455/2001/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2001 establishing the list of priority substances in the field of water policy and amending Directive 2000/60/EC(17) among the priority hazardous substances within the meaning of Article 16(3) of the latter Directive. Under this Directive, specific measures must be adopted at Community with a view to the cessation or phasing out of discharges emissions and losses within 20 years after their adoption. To date no such measures have been adopted as regards SCCPs. II. PROCEDURE (28) At the time of adoption of Directive 2002/45/EC, the Dutch delegation voted against that Directive, stating, in a voting declaration made on 24 April 2002, that the implementation of a Directive on SCCPs would make it impossible for the Netherlands to discharge its international obligations under the Paris Convention and PARCOM Decision 95/1. (29) By letter of the Office of the Permanent Representative of the Kingdom of The Netherlands to the European Union of 17 January 2003, the Dutch Government notified to the Commission its national provisions on the use of SCCPs that it intends to maintain after the adoption of Directive 2002/45/EC. (30) By letter of 25 March 2003, the Commission informed the Dutch Government that it had received the notification under Article 95(4) of the Treaty and that the six-month period for its examination under Article 95(6) started on 22 January 2003, the day following the day on which the notification was received. (31) By letter of 15 April 2003, the Commission informed the other Member States of the notification received from the Netherlands. The Commission also published a notice regarding the notification in the Official Journal of the European Union(18) in order to inform other interested parties of the national provisions that the Netherlands intends to maintain as well as of the grounds invoked to that effect. III. ASSESSMENT 1. Admissibility (32) Article 95(4) concerns cases in which the national provisions are notified in relation to a Community harmonisation measure, they were adopted and entered into force before the adoption of the latter and the maintenance of which would be incompatible with it. (33) The national provisions were notified in relation to Directive 2002/45/EC, a harmonisation measure adopted on the basis of Article 95 of the Treaty. They were adopted and entered into force in 1999, therefore before the adoption of that Directive. As regards the issue as to whether and to which extent the national provisions are incompatible with the Directive, the Netherlands takes the view that its national provisions are only partially incompatible with those laid down in the Directive 2002/45/EC. In its view, the harmonisation provisions of Directive 2002/45/EC relate exclusively to the applications which it expressly restricts(19), i.e. the use of SCCPs in metalworking and for the fat liquoring of leather. The Netherlands claims that this interpretation is borne out by the wording of the Directive and follows logically from the precautionary principle(20). In this specific regard, the Netherlands argues that if Directive 2002/45/EC were assumed to be a measure of total harmonisation, new uses of SCCPs which could pose significant risks to human health and the environment would have to be allowed on an unregulated basis. The Netherlands concludes that its national provisions, in so far as they cover uses other than those subject to the restrictions laid down in Directive 2002/45/EC, fall outside the harmonisation requirements of the latter and need not be considered for the purposes of Article 95(4) of the Treaty. (34) The Commission does not share the views expressed by the Netherlands. According to a well-established case law, a Community measure has to be interpreted in the light of the objectives pursued. Directive 2002/45/EC is based on Article 95(1) of the Treaty, which is the legal basis for the adoption of harmonisation measures having as their object the establishing and functioning of the internal market. It is clear from recital 1 of that Directive that its main objective is to remove the obstacles to the completion and the functioning of the internal market resulting from the limitations already adopted or planned by certain Member States on the use of SCCPs following PARCOM Decision 95/1. It is also clear from recital 3 that Directive 2002/45/EC is based on the results of the Community risk-assessment of SCCPs, which covered all current uses of SCCPs. The Commission therefore considers that Directive 2002/45/EC has to be interpreted as having introduced a harmonisation of all the current uses of SCCPs covered by the Community risk assessment, thus preventing Member States from introducing or maintaining national restrictions on the use of SCCPs going further than those laid down in that Directive. (35) A comparison between the notified national provisions and Directive 2002/45/EC is drawn in the following table: >TABLE> (36) It emerges from the table above that the notified national provisions diverge from the requirements of Directive 2002/45/EC in the following respects: - the use of SCCPs with a chlorination degree of not less than 48 % as plasticizing substances in paints, coatings or sealants and as flame-retardant substances in rubber, plastics or textiles, which is not to be subjected to restrictions on the marketing and use under the Directive, is prohibited in the Netherlands; - the use in metal working fluids of substances and preparations in which SCCPs with a chlorination degree of not less than 48 % are present as constituents, which is not to be subjected to restrictions on the marketing and use under the Directive if SCCPs are present in a concentration below 1 %, is prohibited in the Netherlands. (37) The national provisions do not cover either the use of SCCPs as substances or as constituents of other substances and preparations for the fat liquoring of leather or the use of SCCPs with a chlorination degree below 48 % as substances or as costituents of other substances and preparations in metal-working fluids. According to the information in the possession of the Commission, these uses are still unregulated and therefore allowed in the Netherlands. In this regard, the Commission recalls that Article 95(4) can only be invoked in relation to national provisions being incompatible with a Community harmonisation measure and not to the absence of national regulatory measures the introduction of which is required under a Community harmonisation measure. The application submitted by the Netherlands under Article 95(4) is therefore without prejudice to the obligations incumbent upon the Netherlands to timely and correctly transpose into the Dutch legal order the provisions of Directive 2002/45/EC. (38) Furthermore Article 95(4) requires that the notification of the national provisions be accompanied by a description of the grounds relating to one or more of the major needs referred to in Article 30 or to the protection of the environment or the working environment. The application submitted by the Netherlands contains an explanation of the reasons relating to the protection of the environment and human health which, in the opinion of the Netherlands, justify the maintenance of its national provisions. (39) In the light of the foregoing, the Commission considers that the application submitted by the Netherlands with a view to obtaining authorisation to maintain its national provisions on SCCPs is admissible. 2. Merits (40) In accordance with Article 95(4) and (6), first subparagraph, of the Treaty, the Commission must ascertain that all the conditions enabling a Member State to maintain its national provisions derogating from a Community harmonisation measure provided for in that Article are fulfilled. In particular, the national provisions have to be justified by the major needs referred to in Article 30 of the Treaty or relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment, must not be a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States and must not constitute an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market. (41) According to Article 95(6), first subparagraph, the Commission shall take a decision within six months of the notification. However, under Article 95(6), third subparagraph, the Commission may notify to the Member State concerned that this period may be extended for a further period of up to six months if this is justified by the complexity of the matter and there is no danger for human health. 2.1. Justification on grounds of major needs referred to in Article 30 or relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment (42) The Netherlands considers that its national provisions are necessary to protect the aquatic environment and human health from the risks arising from the current uses of SCCPs. Reference is made to the precautionary principle. In its view, this principle has to be interpreted to mean that it cannot be expected to wait until a serious problem occurs, especially in view of the importance of high-quality ground and surface water for public health. The Netherlands recalls that SCCPs are extremely dangerous substances. They are classified as dangerous for both human health and the environment under Directive 67/548/EEC. They are also considered to be persistent and particularly harmful to the aquatic environment under the OSPAR Convention and, in view of their presence in the environment it was decided to phase out their uses through Paris commission (now OSPAR commission) Decision 95/1. The Netherlands points out that SCCPs pose a serious threat to the Dutch aquatic environment. This would be clearly highlighted in a study by a Dutch toxicology consultant enclosed in the notification submitted by the Netherlands. Public health is also claimed to be at risk due to the fact that both surface water and groundwater are widely used for the abstraction of drinking water in the Netherlands. (43) In assessing whether the national provisions fulfil the conditions laid down in Article 95(4), the Commission considers that due consideration must be given not only to the supporting evidence submitted by the Netherlands but also to all relevant data and information in the Commission's possession and, in particular, to the results of the risk assessments carried out in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and all other available evidence referred to in Section I.4 of the present Decision. 2.2. Recourse to Article 95(6), third subparagraph, of the Treaty (44) After a careful examination of these data and information, the Commission considers that the conditions laid down in Article 95(6), third subparagraph, are met in order for it to have recourse to the possibility of extending the six-month period within which it has to approve or reject the national provisions provided for by that Article. 2.2.1. Justification based on the complexity of the matter (45) It emerges from the examination of the notification file submitted by the Netherlands that the only supporting evidence enclosed is the Dutch study mentioned above. Finalised in 1996, this study focuses on the risks of SCCPs in the Netherlands. However, in contrast with what the Netherlands claims, this study does not highlight a risk for the Dutch aquatic environment and the Dutch population. On the contrary, it upholds the conclusions of a previous report(21) that ""based on the scanty information on exposure and effect levels, chlorinated paraffins do not seem to present a significant risk to humans and ecosystems in the Netherlands"". This study does not therefore appear to support the grounds invoked by the Netherlands for maintaining the national provisions. (46) As reported above, the original Community risk assessment report on SCCPs finalised in 1999 does not highlight concerns for both human health and the environment from the uses of SCCPs other than in metal-working and for leather finishing which would justify risk reduction measures. These conclusions were confirmed by the CSTEE in its opinion of 27 November 1998. After careful evaluation of the new information on SCCPs, while also expressly considering the provisions of Directive 2002/45/EC, the CSTEE concluded in its opinion 22 December 2002 that this information does not highlight any need to change the conclusions of the Community risk assessment. (47) However, the conclusions of the draft updated risk assessment report produced by the United Kingdom in February 2003 diverge from the conclusions of the original Community risk assessment report. (48) This draft report considers further data and provides a more comprehensive analysis of the risks from the uses of SCCPs other than those subject to the marketing and use restrictions laid down in Directive 2002/45/EC. Although this document is expressly referred to as a draft and is only intended for further discussions and review by the Member States' experts(22) in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 793/93, the Commission considers that it is relevant for its assessment of the justification of the national provisions under Article 95(4). (49) The draft report highlights certain possible environmental risks from all uses of SCCPs, except in sealants. However, further exposure information and testing are considered to be necessary in order to obtain more reliable results. The report also highlights potential risks to the marine environment in relation to the likely PBT properties of SCCPs. These substances have been identified as being potentially persistent or potentially very persistent, very bioaccumulative and toxic. The report suggests that further testing could be performed although considerable time would be necessary to conclude on a more solid scientific basis that the substance is actually persistent. Use in rubber, paints and textiles, and products in use over extended periods of time have been identified as being potential sources and pathways to the marine environment. Finally, the draft report identifies potential risks to soil from various sources, suggesting that consideration could be given to carrying out further biodegradation testing of SCCPs in this environmental compartment. Despite these scientific knowledge gaps, the United Kingdom expresses the view that the available data highlighting the potential risks to the marine environment and soil raise a serious concern and suggests that consideration could already be given to precautionary risk management measures. (50) The results of the draft updated risk assessment indicate that the relevant available data and information are still not sufficient to conclude that the environmental risks highlighted therein actually exist and that further information and testing would be necessary to reduce the uncertainties of the risk assessment. On the other hand, the concerns expressed by the United Kingdom seem to suggest that these data and information may justify consideration of risk reduction measures based on a precautionary approach. However, the draft report neither fully identifies the uses of SCCPs which give rise to concern nor the extent to which risk reduction measures could be justified to adequately address those concerns. (51) In view of the provisional character of the draft updated risk assessment report and the consequent unclear indications that emerge from it, the Commission considers that an examination of this draft by the CSTEE (as well as of all other possible relevant available information) is necessary with a view to clarifying as far as possible the issues raised by the results of the draft updated risk assessment report and subsequently assessing the notified national provisions. The Commission Decision under Article 95(6), first subparagraph, should therefore await the outcome of this review. In these circumstances and in view of the fact that the updated draft risk assessment report was made available to the Commission after the notification of the national provisions, the Commission considers that it is justified to extend the six-month period within which it has to approve or reject the national provisions for a further period in order to allow for a careful evaluation of all available relevant evidence and to draw the consequences as regards the national provisions. To this end, a period expiring on 20 December 2003 is necessary. 2.2.2. Absence of danger to human health (52) As indicated above, neither the study referred to in the application submitted by the Netherlands nor the relevant available data and information in the Commission's possession highlight an actual danger to human health. (53) Therefore, the Commission considers that the condition of absence of danger to health is met. IV. CONCLUSION (54) In the light of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that the application that the Netherlands notified to it on 21 January 2003 with a view to obtaining approval of its national provisions on the use of SCCPs is admissible. (55) However, in view of the complexity of the matter and of the absence of evidence highlighting a danger for human health, the Commission considers it justified to extend the period referred to in Article 95(6), first subparagraph, for a further period expiring on 20 December 2003, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Pursuant Article 95(6), third subparagraph, of the Treaty, the period referred to in the first subparagraph of the said Article to approve or reject the national provisions on SCCPs notified by the Netherlands on 21 January 2003 pursuant to Article 95(4) is extended until 20 December 2003.

whereas the detailed rules on the utilization of such samples must guarantee representativeness and the possibility of checking the results of official analyses throughout the Community; whereas, to enable Member States to admit duty-free with a minimum of customs formalities samples officially collected in a Member State and sent from that Member State to a laboratory situated in the territory of another Member State, provision should be made for a special label for the transmission of such samples; Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90 (4) recognizes as a Community method the application of nuclear magnetic resonance for the detection of enrichment of rectified concentrated grape musts and wines; whereas in order to facilitate the interpretation of the results of this analysis carried out in all the Appropriately equipped laboratories in the Community and to ensure that the results of analyses carried out in different laboratories can be compared, uniform rules should be laid down concerning the collection of grape samples and the vinification and keeping of the samples; Whereas in order to ensure that the collecting of samples of grapes from vines for analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance can proceed in normal conditions, provision should be made for the winegrowers concerned to facilitate such collection and to provide the information required under this Regulation; Whereas, given the usefulness of the information stored in the databank of the Joint Research Centre at Ispra, hereinafter referred to as the 'JRC', as referred to in Article 16 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2048/89, for the purpose of monitoring the correct application of Community rules concerning the alcoholic strength by volume of wine products, particularly as regards the use of sucrose, provision should be made for the Commission to ensure the coordination and execution of the collection and further treatment of samples of grapes to be analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance of deuterium, the results of which analyses are to be entered in the abovementioned databank; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2348/91 of 29 July 1977 concerning a databank for the results of analyses of wine products by nuclear magnetic resonance of deuterium (5) lays down the detailed rules of application for the creation of this databank; Whereas in order to simplify administratively the question of responsibility for costs of taking and sending samples, making analytical and organoleptic examinations and engaging the services of exxperts, the principle should be laid down that these costs ape to be met by the body which ordered the sample to be taken or the expert to be engaged; Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1714/81 of 26 June 1981 on detailed implementing rules for direct cooperation between the bodies designated to verify compliance with provisions in the wine sector (6) contains rules concerning the collection of samples to be sent to an official laboratory in another Member State, and certain provisions which have been superseded by subsequent Community provisions; whereas the Regulation in question should therefore be redrafted and rules should be laid down on the collection of samples intended for analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance of deuterium as a special case of collecting samples of a wine product within the framework of the direct cooperation between the bodies responsible for verifying compliance with Community provisions in different Member States; Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Field of application This Regulation lays down the rules governing the collection of the samples of wine products referred to in the fourth indent of Article 5 and in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2048/89, where such samples are: (a) to be sent for analytical or organoleptic examination at an official laboratory situated in the territory of a Member State other than the Member State in which the sample was collected, or to a Community body; (b) to be analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance of deuterium in an official laboratory of a Member State or at the JRC. This Regulation also lays down common rules on the collection of samples of fresh grapes to be analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance of deuterium, the results of which analyses are to be entered in the databank set up at the JRC. Article 2 Collection of samples in the context of cooperation between the competent bodiers 1. When samples of wine, grape must or another liquid wine products as referred to in the frist subparagraph of Article 1 are taken, the official of the competent body entrusted with this task shall ensure that: - in the case of products in containers of not more than 60 litres warehoused in one lot, the samples are representative of the entire lot, - in the case of products in containers with a nominal capacity of more than 60 litres, the samples are representative of the contents of the container from which teh samples are taken. Samples shall be taken by a representative of the competent authorities authorized for this purpose. 2. Samples shall be taken by pouring the product in question into a least five clean containers each having a nominal capacity of not less than 0,5 litre. In the case of products as referred to in the first indent of paragraph 1, sampling may also take the form of removing at least five containers having a nominal capacity of not less than 75 cl from the lot to be examined. Where samples of distilled wine are to be analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance of deuterium, the samples shall be palced in containers having a nominal capacity of 25 cl, or even 5 cl where they are to be sent from one official laboratory to another. The samples shall be taken, closed where appropriate, and sealed in the presence of a representative of the establishment where the sample is taken or of a representative of the carrier if the smaple is taken during transport. If no respresentative is present, the report referred to in paragraph 4 shall mention this fact. Each sample shall be fitted with an inert and non-reusable closure. 3. Each sample shall bear a label which complies with part A of Annex I, made out in one of the official languages of the Community. Where the size of the container is too small for the prescribed label to be attached thereto, the container shall be marked with an indelible number and the required information shall be indicated on a separate sheet. The representative of the establishment where the sample is taken or the respresentative of the carrier shall be requested to sign the label or, as applicable, the sheet. 4. The official of the competent body authorized to take samples shall draw up a written report in which he shall note any observations he considers important for assessing the samples. In the report he shall note, where necessary, any statements by the carrier's representative or the representative of the establishment where the sample was taken, and shall request such representative to affix his signature. He shall note the amount of the product from which the sample was taken. If the signatures referred to above and in the third subparagraph of paragraph 3 have been refused, the report shall mention this fact. 5. Wherever samples are taken, one of the samples shall remain as a control sample in the establishment where the sample was taken, and another with the competent authority which ordered the sample to be taken. Three of the samples shall be sent for examination to an official laboratory, which will carry out the analytical or organoleptic examination. There one of the samples shall be analysed. Another shall be kept as a control sample. Control samples shall be kept for a minimum period of three years after sampling. 6. Consignments of samples shall bear on the external packaging a red label complying with the model set out in part B of Annex I. The label shall be approximately 50 mm × 25 mm. When sending samples, the competent body of the Member State from which the samples are sent shall affix its stamp partially on the outer packaging of the parcel and partially on the red label. Article 3 Collection of samples of fresh grapes to be analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance 1. The following special provisions shall apply to the collection, treatment and keeping of samples of fresh grapes to be made into wine for the analysis referred to in the second paragraph of Article 1 by nuclear magnetic resonance of deuterium at the official laboratories or at officially recognized laboratories of the Member States and at the JRC. The conditions for collecting samples of fresh grapes, and for their subsequent vinification and keeping by the competent body or by a department authorized by the latter are set out in Annex II. 2. Cultivators of vines from which grapes are taken by officials of a competent body: - may not impede such collection in any way, and - must provide such officials with all the information required under this Regulation. 3. The Commission shall, if necessary through action by the specific officials referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 2048/89, ensure the coordination and execution, in accordance with this Regulation, of the collection and further treatment of samples of fresh grapes to be analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance of deuterium, the results of which analyses are to be entered in the databank of the JRC. Article 4 Costs of collection, dispatch and analysis of samples 1. The costs incurred in taking, treating and sending a sample and in carrying out analytical and organoleptic examinations shall be borne by the body of the Member State which asked for the sample to be taken. Such costs shall be calculated according to the rates applicable in the Member State in the territory of which the operations were carried out. 2. The costs incurred in sending the samples referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2348/91 to the JCR or to another laboratory designated by the JCR for analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance shall be borne by the Community. When the JCR requests the taking of other samples, in addition to the samples referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2348/91, - half the costs incurred in taking the sample of fresh grapes and its treatment shall be borne by the member State concerned and the other half by the Community and - the costs incurred in sending the samples to the JCR or to another laboratory designated by the JCR for analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance shall be borne by the Community. For Member States which do not have a laboratory equipped for wine analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance, the costs incurred in sending to the JCR all the samples to be taken pursuant to Article 2 (1) shall be borne by the Community. Article 5 Subsistence and travelling expenses The subsistence and travelling expenses incurred as a result of engaging an official appointed by a competent body shall be calcultated according to the rates applicable in the Member State where the official normally works. These expenses shall be borne by the competent bodies which asked for the official to be engaged. Article 6 Regulation (EEC) No 1714/81 is hereby repealed.

"The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed. Repair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water. Trains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct. Many businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage. The waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare. Jeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit. However, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail. ""It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we're neglected or forgotten,"" she said. ""That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days. ""Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?"" Meanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain. Peebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area. Scottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs. The Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand. He said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process. ""I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,"" he said. ""Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses."" He said it was important that ""immediate steps"" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.

"ORANGE COUNTY, California (CNN) -- One of the larger fires in Southern California was deliberately started by someone with apparent knowledge of arson, a fire official said Thursday. Firefighter Luke Perisin sets a backfire Wednesday against the Santiago Fire in Live Oak Canyon, California. The Santiago Fire in Orange County was started in two places along a little-traveled road, according to Chief Chip Prather of the county's fire authority. The fire, which has burned more than 25,000 acres, was started in brush just off Santiago Canyon Road, not close to homes. It spread rapidly, indicating the arsonist had some knowledge of winds and other factors. ""It is a confirmed arson. There was evidence found at the scene. That is the purpose of our early declaration of it being an arson-caused fire,"" Prather said. He would not describe the evidence. Watch how the evidence points to arson » . Prather said officials originally thought the fire had three points of origin instead of two. The Santiago Fire's points of origin are considered crime scenes, said Jim Amornino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. The reward for information leading to an arrest has increased to $250,000 -- $50,000 each from the governor's office, the U.S. agency of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the FBI, Prather said. KFI radio has chipped in another $100,000, the sheriff's department said. The state established a toll-free arson tip line at 800-540-7085. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said anyone convicted of arson would be dealt with harshly. If a suspect is to be found, ""it's going to be by a clue from the public,"" said county Sheriff Mike Corona. About 1,100 firefighters were working on controlling the Santiago Fire, which has destroyed at least 22 structures, according to Orange County Fire Battalion Chief Kris Concepcion. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the fire was only 30 percent contained Thursday morning after being 50 percent contained the day before. Watch the Santiago flames rage » . The motive of the Santiago Fire's arsonist was a mystery to Concepcion. ""That's the part that I really can't figure out, to tell you the truth,"" he told CNN. ""That individual knew on Sunday when this fire started that we had, really, the perfect storm, if you will. We had the heavy Santa Ana winds, we had the low relative humidities, we had the high temperatures. ""And then for someone to even think about doing something as reprehensible as starting a fire where they knew the fire would grow as rapidly as it would -- traveling about three, 3½ miles in about an hour -- is just really absolutely unconscionable,"" he said. The smaller Rosa Fire in Riverside County, 100 percent contained at 411 acres Thursday morning, was also probably arson, state officials said. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Fire Department investigators are looking into whether a man who was arrested on suspicion of arson in the San Fernando Valley may have had a role in any of the ongoing blazes, an L.A. police spokeswoman said. Catalino Pineda, 41, was arrested Wednesday, Officer Kate Lopez told CNN. Witnesses told police they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside in the West Hills area of San Fernando -- northwest of Los Angeles -- then walking away, Lopez said. Pineda was already on probation for ""making excessive false emergency reports"" to police at the time of the arrest, Lopez said. His bail has been set at $75,000, she said. The fire he allegedly set was brought under control, but now authorities want to find out if he had any role in the other wildfires. In San Bernardino County, John Alfred Rund, 48, was arrested Tuesday evening and charged with setting a small fire along a rural roadside near Victorville. Rund was to be arraigned Thursday morning in Victorville. He was being held in lieu of $750,000 bail. The county's district attorney's office on Thursday also filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands. A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on $250,000 bail and will be arraigned later Thursday. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department also arrested an adult and a juvenile accused by an anonymous tipster of starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county. In a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava. The Vista Fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said. Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley Fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 10,152-acre Slide Fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said.

The auctioneers said the hut is ""in need of some TLC"" - but does include part of the beach in front of the hut into the sea.

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- A magnitude 4.2 earthquake shook the San Francisco area Friday at 4:42 a.m. PT (7:42 a.m. ET), the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake left about 2,000 customers without power, said David Eisenhower, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Light. Under the USGS classification, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake is considered ""light,"" which it says usually causes minimal damage. ""We had quite a spike in calls, mostly calls of inquiry, none of any injury, none of any damage that was reported,"" said Capt. Al Casciato of the San Francisco police. ""It was fairly mild."" Watch police describe concerned calls immediately after the quake » . The quake was centered about two miles east-northeast of Oakland, at a depth of 3.6 miles, the USGS said. Oakland is just east of San Francisco, across San Francisco Bay. An Oakland police dispatcher told CNN the quake set off alarms at people's homes. The shaking lasted about 50 seconds, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. According to the USGS, magnitude 4.2 quakes are felt indoors and may break dishes and windows and overturn unstable objects. Pendulum clocks may stop. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- White House press secretary Tony Snow, who is undergoing treatment for cancer, will step down from his post September 14 and be replaced by deputy press secretary Dana Perino, the White House announced Friday. White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14. President Bush told reporters Friday that he will ""sadly accept"" Snow's resignation. Flanked by Snow and Perino in the White House press room, the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary. ""It's been a joy to watch him spar with you,"" Bush told reporters. Watch the announcement about Snow leaving » . Bush said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow. ""He'll battle cancer and win,"" Bush said, ""and he'll be a solid contributor to society."" Turning to Snow, the president then said: ""I love you, and I wish you all the best."" Snow, speaking after Bush at the start of the daily White House news conference, said he was leaving to earn more money. He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News. According to The Washington Post, Snow makes $168,000 as the White House spokesman. His family took out a loan when he started the job, ""and that loan is now gone."" ""This job has really been a dream for me, a blast. I've had an enormous amount of fun and satisfaction,"" Snow said. He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do ""some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties."" Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness. Snow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005. His colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission. Perino announced March 27 that Snow's cancer had recurred, and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before. Sources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job, possibly as early as September. Bush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006. Snow had been an anchor for ""Fox News Sunday"" and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel, which he joined in 1996. He also hosted ""The Tony Snow Show"" on Fox News Radio. On Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month that found the cancer has not spread. ""The tumors are stable -- they are not growing,"" Snow said of the results from an MRI and a CAT scan. ""And there are no new growths. The health is good."" The press secretary, whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment, said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month. ""I'm also putting on weight again,"" he said after returning from a 10-day vacation. ""I actually feel very good about"" the health situation. Snow said on Friday he was to see his oncologist, and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"Commission Regulation (EC) No 843/2002 of 21 May 2002 laying down the marketing standard for strawberries and amending Regulation (EEC) No 899/87 THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2002(2), and in particular Article 2(2) and Article 3(3)(c) thereof, Whereas: (1) Strawberries are among the products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 for which standards must be adopted. Commission Regulation (EEC) No 899/87 of 30 March 1987 laying down quality standards for cherries and strawberries(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 888/97(4), has been amended and can no longer ensure legal clarity. (2) For clarity, the rules on strawberries should be separated from those on other products under Regulation (EEC) No 899/87. On this occasion, in the interest of preserving transparency on the world market, account should be taken of the standard for strawberries recommended by the Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE). The rules concerning strawberries should therefore be recast and Regulation (EEC) No 899/87 amended accordingly. (3) Application of new standards should remove products of unsatisfactory quality from the market, bring production into line with consumer requirements and facilitate trade based on fair competition, thereby helping to improve profitability. (4) The standards are applicable at all marketing stages. Long-distance transport, storage over a certain period and the various processes the products undergo may cause some degree of deterioration owing to the biological development of the products or their perishable nature. Account should be taken of such deterioration when applying the standard at the marketing stages following dispatch. As products in the ""Extra"" Class have to be particularly carefully sorted and packaged, only lack of freshness and turgidity is to be taken into account in their case. (5) Sufficient maturity should be one of the minimum requirements for strawberries. Existing scientific and technical data do not permit reliable and objective criteria for assessing this requirement to be defined. (6) The marketing without calyx of strawberries of certain varieties that easily lose their calyx at harvest is traditional in the region of production in Finland and in Denmark. These two Member States have, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, requested that strawberries produced and consumed in those regions should not have to comply with the standards. This Regulation should therefore include a derogation to that effect. (7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 The marketing standard for strawberries falling within CN code 0810 10 00 shall be as set out in the Annex. The standard shall apply at all marketing stages under the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2200/96. However, at stages following dispatch, products may show in relation to the requirements of the standard: (a) a slight lack of freshness and turgidity; (b) for products graded in classes other than the ""Extra"" Class, slight deteriorations due to their development and their tendency to perish. Article 2 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Regulation, strawberries of varieties that easily lose their calyx at harvest may be sold without calyx in the region of production in Finland and in Denmark. 2. For the application of paragraph 1, each package or lot shall bear, in addition to the other indication required, the following indication: - in Finnish: ""myydään ainoastaan ... (region of production)"", - in Danish: ""må kun sælges i ... (region of production)"", - in Swedish: ""får endast säljas i ... (region of production)."" Article 3 Regulation (EEC) No 899/87 is amended as follows: (a) The title is replaced by the following: ""Commission Regulation (EEC) No 899/87 of 30 March 1987 laying down quality standards for cherries"". (b) Article 1(1) is replaced by the following: ""1. The marketing standards for cherries, falling within CN code 0809 20 95, shall be as set out in the Annex."" (c) Annex II is deleted. (d) In Annex I, the words ""Annex I"" are replaced by the following word: ""Annex"". Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. It shall apply from the first day of the third month following its entry into force. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Article 2 To qualify for payment of the aid referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96, prunes must comply with the characteristics set out in Annex I(B) and have been obtained from dried plums complying with the characteristics set out in Annex I(A) for which the minimum price has been paid in full. Article 3 1. The minimum price payable to producers for dried plums and the production aid for prunes shall be fixed per 100 kilograms net for products with a maximum moisture content of 23 % in the size category corresponding to 66 fruits per 500 g. For other size categories the minimum price and the aid shall be multiplied by one of the coefficients listed in Annex II. 2. For the purpose of applying the minimum price and production aid to semi-dry prunes, the size and weight shall be taken as the equivalent size and weight of dried plums and dry prunes, multiplying the size by 1,18461 and the weight by 0,84416. Article 4 Where processing takes place outside the Member State in which the product was grown, that Member State shall furnish proof to the Member State paying the production aid that the minimum price payable to the producer has been paid. Article 5 1. Verification of the quality requirements for dried plums shall be carried out on the basis of samples taken by the processor from a lot, before sizing and in agreement with the producer. The samples shall be examined by both the processor and the producer and the results of the verification shall be recorded. 2. For prunes during the processing period the processor shall verify by sampling of each lot that the products meet the qualifying requirements for aid. The verification results shall be recorded. The minimum net weight of each sample examined shall be 1 kg. Article 6 Member States shall take the necessary steps to satisfy themselves, in particular by checking stock records, that prunes which have received aid are subsequently processed into products as referred to in Article 1(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 504/97.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Attacks are down 75 percent in recent months in a perilous stretch of neighborhoods in northeastern Baghdad, prompting a U.S. military officer to proclaim Monday that security there is ""dramatically improving."" Concerned citizens have helped troops improve security in parts of Baghdad, a military official says. People line the streets, cars congest them, trash collectors and other city workers have returned, local leaders are holding community meetings again and ""markets have come back like gangbusters,"" said Army Col. Don Farris, commander of 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. He added that the largely Sunni al Qaeda in Iraq presence has been ""crushed"" since the beginning of May. However, there are still dangers, most notably the threats posed by Iranian-backed Shiite militants, Farris said. Speaking to Pentagon reporters via video link from Baghdad, Farris cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation. Among them is the ""surge,"" the additional U.S. troops deployed earlier this year. Watch how old rivalries have been posing problems » . Also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and the development of a program that employs ""concerned local citizens"" to assist U.S. and Iraqi forces, Farris said. Some of those citizens are members of local Sunni ""awakening councils,"" comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area. Especially in the last six weeks, Farris said, civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests, two Iranian operatives among them . ""From my foxhole, in our sector, it is working,"" he said of the improving security in the area. ""I can only speak to what I see in my sector and I am encouraged."" Farris' sector -- which includes the Sunni-dominated district of Adhamiya and Sadr City, the Shiite slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a ""remarkable turnaround,"" he said. Many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads. Despite improvements in the security situation, Farris warned that ""we still have a lot of work to do"" because there doesn't appear to be any sign that Shiite extremists with links to Iran are halting their activities. Farris said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators, which are often delivered or manufactured by Iran. Nine such bombs were found in late October, he said. There are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into Sadr City, he said. There are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area, Farris said, because ""essential services"" like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff. Though a ""trickle"" of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return, Farris said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape. Paul Folmsbee, a State Department provincial reconstruction team leader, said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law, governance, economic development and essential services. Farris' Monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by U.S. and Iraqi military officials over recent weeks. The military officials say they are seeing signs of Sunni-Shiite reconciliation. At a press conference earlier Monday in Baghdad, Brig. Gen. Ed Cardon, deputy commander for support of Multi-National Division-Center, discussed a ""definite period of progress"" in his region on the southern Baghdad outskirts. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"Simone Favaro got the crucial try with the last move of the game, following earlier touchdowns by Chris Fusaro, Zander Fagerson and Junior Bulumakau. Rynard Landman and Ashton Hewitt got a try in either half for the Dragons. Glasgow showed far superior strength in depth as they took control of a messy match in the second period. Home coach Gregor Townsend gave a debut to powerhouse Fijian-born Wallaby wing Taqele Naiyaravoro, and centre Alex Dunbar returned from long-term injury, while the Dragons gave first starts of the season to wing Aled Brew and hooker Elliot Dee. Glasgow lost hooker Pat McArthur to an early shoulder injury but took advantage of their first pressure when Rory Clegg slotted over a penalty on 12 minutes. It took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards. Glasgow struck back when Fusaro drove over from a rolling maul on 35 minutes for Clegg to convert. But the Dragons levelled at 10-10 before half-time when Naiyaravoro was yellow-carded for an aerial tackle on Brew and Tovey slotted the easy goal. The visitors could not make the most of their one-man advantage after the break as their error count cost them dearly. It was Glasgow's bench experience that showed when Mike Blair's break led to a short-range score from teenage prop Fagerson, converted by Clegg. Debutant Favaro was the second home player to be sin-binned, on 63 minutes, but again the Warriors made light of it as replacement wing Bulumakau, a recruit from the Army, pounced to deftly hack through a bouncing ball for an opportunist try. The Dragons got back within striking range with some excellent combined handling putting Hewitt over unopposed after 72 minutes. However, Favaro became sinner-turned-saint as he got on the end of another effective rolling maul to earn his side the extra point with the last move of the game, Clegg converting. Dragons director of rugby Lyn Jones said: ""We're disappointed to have lost but our performance was a lot better [than against Leinster] and the game could have gone either way. ""Unfortunately too many errors behind the scrum cost us a great deal, though from where we were a fortnight ago in Dublin our workrate and desire was excellent. ""It was simply error count from individuals behind the scrum that cost us field position, it's not rocket science - they were correct in how they played and we had a few errors, that was the difference.""

"To simply say that The Massive Monkees were better dancers is a bit of an overstatement. Hitting the moves on the beat is the basics of not only breakdancing, but all dancing. You can't say that what Jinjo Crew did was nothing but a bunch of stunts while claiming that The Massive Monkees did was the are of dance. The Massive Monkees didn't just beat some group of guys that were good at stunts, they beat THE Jinjo Crew. If you knew anything about the B-boy scene, you would know who they are. Both crews put on an amazing performance, which we should be thankful for seeing. To say otherwise would be an insult to the blood and sweat poured into this performance by both crews. If you want to look at how the judges scored, Jinjo Crew beat the Massive Monkees on execution and lost on foundation and originality. Individually, I would have to say that Jinjo Crew had better dancers. Their moves were quicker, cleaner, and, on average, more complicated. However, The Massive Monkees did an amazing job showing off their flow of creativity and their teamwork. That is why the judges gave them the win. It gets easy for things to get biased when we put thing in terms of ""USA vs Korea"" or Country X vs Country Y. When our team loses, it's because of biased judging and the other team cheated.

"DIRECTIVE 97/55/EC OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 6 October 1997 amending Directive 84/450/EEC concerning misleading advertising so as to include comparative advertising THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 25 June 1997, (1) Whereas one of the Community's main aims is to complete the internal market; whereas measures must be adopted to ensure the smooth running of the said market; whereas the internal market comprises an area which has no internal frontiers and in which goods, persons, services and capital can move freely; (2) Whereas the completion of the internal market will mean an ever wider range of choice; whereas, given that consumers can and must make the best possible use of the internal market, and that advertising is a very important means of creating genuine outlets for all goods and services throughout the Community, the basic provisions governing the form and content of comparative advertising should be uniform and the conditions of the use of comparative advertising in the Member States should be harmonized; whereas if these conditions are met, this will help demonstrate objectively the merits of the various comparable products; whereas comparative advertising can also stimulate competition between suppliers of goods and services to the consumer's advantage; (3) Whereas the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the individual Member States concerning comparative advertising differ widely; whereas advertising reaches beyond the frontiers and is received on the territory of other Member States; whereas the acceptance or non-acceptance of comparative advertising according to the various national laws may constitute an obstacle to the free movement of goods and services and create distortions of competition; whereas, in particular, firms may be exposed to forms of advertising developed by competitors to which they cannot reply in equal measure; whereas the freedom to provide services relating to comparative advertising should be assured; whereas the Community is called on to remedy the situation; (4) Whereas the sixth recital of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 relating to the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning misleading advertising (4) states that, after the harmonization of national provisions against misleading advertising, 'at a second stage . . ., as far as necessary, comparative advertising should be dealt with, on the basis of appropriate Commission proposals`; (5) Whereas point 3 (d) of the Annex to the Council Resolution of 14 April 1975 on a preliminary programme of the European Economic Community for a consumer protection and information policy (5) includes the right to information among the basic rights of consumers; whereas this right is confirmed by the Council Resolution of 19 May 1981 on a second programme of the European Economic Community for a consumer protection and information policy (6), point 40 of the Annex, which deals specifically with consumer information; whereas comparative advertising, when it compares material, relevant, verifiable and representative features and is not misleading, may be a legitimate means of informing consumers of their advantage; (6) Whereas it is desirable to provide a broad concept of comparative advertising to cover all modes of comparative advertising; (7) Whereas conditions of permitted comparative advertising, as far as the comparison is concerned, should be established in order to determine which practices relating to comparative advertising may distort competition, be detrimental to competitors and have an adverse effect on consumer choice; whereas such conditions of permitted advertising should include criteria of objective comparison of the features of goods and services; (8) Whereas the comparison of the price only of goods and services should be possible if this comparison respects certain conditions, in particular that it shall not be misleading; (9) Whereas, in order to prevent comparative advertising being used in an anti-competitive and unfair manner, only comparisons between competing goods and services meeting the same needs or intended for the same purpose should be permitted; (10) Whereas the international conventions on copyright as well as the national provisions on contractual and non-contractual liability shall apply when the results of comparative tests carried out by third parties are referred to or reproduced in comparative advertising; (11) Whereas the conditions of comparative advertising should be cumulative and respected in their entirety; whereas, in accordance with the Treaty, the choice of forms and methods for the implementation of these conditions shall be left to the Member States, insofar as those forms and methods are not already determined by this Directive; (12) Whereas these conditions should include, in particular, consideration of the provisions resulting from Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (7), and in particular Article 13 thereof, and of the other Community provisions adopted in the agricultural sphere; (13) Whereas Article 5 of First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (8) confers exclusive rights on the proprietor of a registered trade mark, including the right to prevent all third parties from using, in the course of trade, any sign which is identical with, or similar to, the trade mark in relation to identical goods or services or even, where appropriate, other goods; (14) Whereas it may, however, be indispensable, in order to make comparative advertising effective, to identify the goods or services of a competitor, making reference to a trade mark or trade name of which the latter is the proprietor; (15) Whereas such use of another's trade mark, trade name or other distinguishing marks does not breach this exclusive right in cases where it complies with the conditions laid down by this Directive, the intended target being solely to distinguish between them and thus to highlight differences objectively; (16) Whereas provisions should be made for the legal and/or administrative means of redress mentioned in Articles 4 and 5 of Directive 84/450/EEC to be available to control comparative advertising which fails to meet the conditions laid down by this Directive; whereas according to the 16th recital of the Directive, voluntary control by self-regulatory bodies to eliminate misleading advertising may avoid recourse to administrative or juridical action and ought therefore to be encouraged; whereas Article 6 applies to unpermitted comparative advertising in the same way; (17) Whereas national self-regulatory bodies may coordinate their work through associations or organizations established at Community level and inter alia deal with cross-border complaints; (18) Whereas Article 7 of Directive 84/450/EEC allowing Member States to retain or adopt provisions with a view to ensuring more extensive protection for consumers, persons carrying on a trade, business, craft or profession, and the general public, should not apply to comparative advertising, given that the objective of amending the said Directive is to establish conditions under which comparative advertising is permitted;

My mom thought it was ludicrous that I was suspended for literally not doing anything, and its turned out to be the best decision we've ever made. And Kelly's cousin went to juvie right after!

"EL CALABOZ, Texas (CNN) -- Eloisa Tamez said she isn't scared anymore, just determined. ""I am not backing down,"" she said. The U.S. government wants to build a border fence like this one. About 100 landowners are fighting it. Tamez owns three acres of land along the Texas-Mexico border where the Department of Homeland Security would like to build a border fence. The property is a remnant of a 12,000-acre grant from Spain to her family in 1767, before the United States even existed. ""It is my history. It is my heritage,"" Tamez said. This week, the Justice Department began legal action against landowners and municipalities who have refused to give government surveyors access to their land. Tamez expects she will be sued sometime soon, but she is not intimidated. Asked how long she will fight, she said, ""As long as I have to."" Michael Chertoff, the Secretary of Homeland Security, said the fence will not be stopped by opponents like Tamez. ""Can we simply abandon an enterprise because it is a problem for a particular individual?"" Chertoff told CNN. ""I don't think I can accept that."" Watch Chertoff say it's ""civic responsibility"" to give up land » . Chertoff believes a fence would curb the steady stream of illegal immigrants making their way across the border and lessen the flow of drugs. He also argues it will increase the safety of Border Patrol agents who have faced increasing violence. The government wants to build 700 miles of fence along the Mexican border, including 370 miles of it by the end of this year. About 70 miles of fence is to be built in the Rio Grande Valley by year's end, if the government gets its way. The Rio Grande forms a natural barrier along this stretch of the border, but in some places it is narrow enough to swim across. On the banks of the river there is ample evidence that people do so. Piles of underwear lie discarded by swimmers after they make it across. The swimmers change into dry clothes they have carried across in plastic bags. Then they disappear into the United States. The Border Patrol has stepped up its efforts in the Rio Grande Valley with more lights, and sensors to pick up movement. A levee built along the river has a muddy road on top used by Border Patrol vehicles to patrol the area. Richard Cortez, the mayor of the border town of McAllen, Texas, believes hiring more Border Patrol agents, deepening the Rio Grande, and clearing its banks of tall vegetation would provide better border protection than the fence. Cortez calls the fence ""a multibillion-dollar speed bump,"" which will slow, but not stop, illegal immigration. ""It is a false sense of security,"" he said. ""America will not be safe. America will continue to waste resources on something that is not going to work."" Cortez and other border mayors who oppose construction of the fence formed a group called the Texas Border Coalition. The coalition wrote to Chertoff asking for further consultations on the fence, but this week the Department of Homeland Security turned them down. While expressing support for open dialogue with residents and officials, David Pagan of U.S. Customs and Border Protection wrote in an e-mail, ""We do not plan to suspend work on the construction of fence in order to hold a series of additional consultation meetings."" Cortez said his city is contemplating a court test of the law that mandated the construction of the border fence. And so a battle is being waged by about 100 landowners, those like Eloisa Tamez who are standing firm. ""I will not allow them to come and survey my land. I have an American-given right to protect my property,"" she said. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"Assembly Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said although devolved, health was one of the main election issues for voters. ""Wherever you go across Wales people raise the issue of the NHS, and Labour are running the NHS in Wales,"" he said. Labour responded saying that Tory sums on the NHS ""simply don't add up"". Mr Davies said Welsh Conservatives would protect health spending and introduce a cancer drugs fund. He defended his party's decision to campaign on an area of policy that was not controlled in Wales by Westminster. ""(Labour leader) Ed Miliband has used the example of 'compare and contrast', and I think it is perfectly reasonable to point out we don't have a cancer drugs fund here in Wales and some of the most disappointing ambulance response times on record,"" he said. ""There is a real dilemma for voters in May. Do they want to vote for the Conservative party who want to protect health spending or do they endorse a party who have drastically cut health provision in Wales?"" But Welsh Labour's Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething accused the Conservatives of wanting to privatise the NHS. ""The Tories have had three opportunities in the campaign so far to rule out privatising the NHS and they have refused to do so"" he said. He added: ""This election is a clear choice between a Labour government that would invest in the NHS to train an extra 1000 doctors, nurses and front-line staff, or a Tory government that would introduce a tablet tax for sick people and privatise health services.""

"PARIS, France -- World number three Novak Djokovic crashed out of the Paris Masters after being trounced in his opening match by veteran Frenchman Fabrice Santoro on Wednesday. Fabrice Santoro returns the ball during his shock second-round victory against Novak Djokovic. The 34-year-old Santoro, who beat world No. 5 Andy Roddick at the Lyon Grand Prix last week, again rose to the occasion in front of his home fans as he stormed to a 6-3 6-2 second-round victory against the Serb. It was the first time the two players had met, with Djokovic making his first outing since losing to David Nalbandian in the semifinals of the Madrid Masters two weeks ago. Djokovic, like the American Roddick, has already qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup and will now have extra time to prepare for the event in Shanghai starting next month. The 20-year-old said he was struggling following dental surgery to remove two wisdom teeth. ""I couldn't give my 100 percent, not even 30 percent of my possibilities,"" Djokobvic said. ""He deserved to win. I'm still on medications. I didn't practise for a whole week, I only started practising two days ago. Physically, I'm not feeling at all good."" The result is a boost for rising British star Andy Murray, who earlier kept alive his hopes of an unexpected place at the Masters Cup by winning his first match in Paris and was expected to face Djokovic. The 20-year-old, who has missed three months this season due to a wrist injury, beat Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to progress into the third round. The 15th seed is seeking to overtake Tommy Haas, who holds the eighth and final place ahead of the showpiece event in Shanghai. Murray, who trails the German by just three points, has not beaten Djokovic in three meetings so far but he has never played his unseeded next opponent Santoro. Ninth seed Haas, who has struggled with illness and injury this year, will play Djokovic's compatriot Janko Tipsarevic in the second round. Murray, who won his second title this year at the St Petersburg Open last Sunday, made a confident start against Nieminen and showed little sign of the stiff back he suffered after a minor car crash on Monday. He held his serve to love against a player who was beaten in the final of the Swiss Indoors event by Roger Federer last weekend, but then struggled for his best form as the first set went to a tiebreak. The Scot was broken just one point after having a winner overturned following an on-court appeal, but he leveled immediately and then broke Nieminen again to win a third successive game before serving out for victory. Defending champin and fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, one of six players to have already qualified for Shanghai, beat Argentina's Juan Del Potro 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 in his opening match on Wednesday. The Russian, fined for ""lack of effort"" after his defeat by Croatian qualifier Marian Cilic in St Petersburg, will next face Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in round three after Baghdatis shocked 13th seed Ivan Ljubicic. Ivo Karlovic broke Roger Federer's serve for the first time in his life, but the top seed and world number one progressed in a late match on Wednesday. Croatian Karlovic, the tallest man in tennis at 2.08 metres, went down 6-4 4-6 6-3 as Federer played for the first time at the Bercy event since 2003. Federer had gone 67 service games over four previous matches without a loss before Karlovic ended his duck to claim their second set. But the Swiss top seed got straight back in harness, breaking to start the final set and rolling ahead against a man he had just beaten days earlier in the Basel semifinals. World numbet two Rafael Nadal also reached the third round after thrashing Italy's Filippo Volandri 6-3 6-1. The Spaniard will next play Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, who won by the same scoreline against 16th seed Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina. E-mail to a friend .",formal
"You are talking about the Charsi imbue, right? Or a cube upgrade? If we are talking Charsi imbue, you can only imbue WHITE items. This includes superior, but they will not neccesarily be superior after imbuing (they get random base-modifications). Bloodfist and Gorefoot are both uniques (gold), and therefore not eligible for imbuing. When you imbue, the item level matters (the item level is hidden). The item is the same level as the monster who dropped it. That means, that the higher level the monster who dropped it, the more stats is available on that item. It is important to note that an item doesn't neccesarily use all it's stat potential. This means that the same item dropped in a1 and a2 can has the possibility of some very different outcomes. After the imbue, the item can be as good as if the monster itself had dropped a rare (yellow) item. Imbued weapons will always turn out as rare items. To answer your question, you should just progress like you are now, fighting the hardest monsters you can. When a potential good white item appears, try to imbue that. Class specifiq items has a better chance to give +skills to your class. Circlets has the higest bonuses regarding yellow items. And you can get an extra base stat advantage by using exceoptional (nightmare) items, which will drop in a4-5 from time to time. You can check out monster levels, and item qualities (normal, exceptional, elite) on arreat summit ofc. :) EDIT (forgot infoz): In cases of imbue-eligible items with base bonuses (maces, wands, staffs and class specifique items, and any other item with +skills etc.) will loose their current bonuses due to the base item reroll. They can get extra skills from the base item AND the rarity class. Say, if you imbue a staff with +1 fireball, it will reroll that base staff. It might turn out with a staff with +1 icebolt and +1 warmth, and then you add the bonuses the rarity would give you, lets say +1 icebolt and +1 fireball. Then your +1 fireball staff will have turned into a +2 icebolt +1 fireball staff. It might as well turn into any other staff allowed by it's item lvl though. As far as I recall, weapon damage and defense values are not rerolled. I am not 100% positive on this though.

"NYON, Switzerland -- Celtic have been fined $50,800 by UEFA and AC Milan's Dida has been banned for two matches after the incident which saw a pitch-invading supporter approach the Brazilian goalkeeper in last week's Champions League match at Celtic Park. Dida's theatrical over-reaction has resulted in UEFA suspending him for two matches. The incident occurred when the Scottish side beat Milan 2-1 in Glasgow. A fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute, soon after the home side scored their winning goal, and made what appeared to be minimal contact with Dida. The Milan goalkeeper turned to chase the supporter before dropping to the ground. He was carried off the field on a stretcher and replaced. Dida's theatrical over-reaction has cost him severely -- but Celtic may choose not to complain about their own punishment, with half of their fine suspended for two years. UEFA did have the power to change the result of the match, although that was always unlikely. UEFA's control and disciplinary body found Celtic guilty of charges of ""lack of organisation and improper conduct of supporters"", while Dida was found to have breached UEFA's ""principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship"". Milan have pledged to appeal against the punishment, which as it stands means he will miss the club's Champions League games against Shakhtar Donetsk. ""It's a suspension that is absolutely excessive,"" said Milan lawyer Leandro Cantamessa. ""It seems to us a very, very unbalanced sentence. It turns Dida into the protagonist of the incident, whereas the protagonist was someone else, and that's not right from a logical point of view."" Celtic acted swiftly to punish the 27-year-old supporter, who turned himself in and has since admitted a breach of the peace in court and will be sentenced next month. The club banned the fan for life from all their matches, home and away. Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said: ""As a club we feel this penalty is proportionate to the incident in question and a fair outcome."" E-mail to a friend .",formal

"DENVER, Colorado -- A Colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $10,000 on a security system, hired a bodyguard for his son's wedding and never leaves home without a .45-caliber handgun strapped to his chest. Keith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case. The man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family. A report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado. Paul Logli, chairman of National District Attorneys Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become ""almost epidemic,"" according to the Denver Post. When asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of Colorado's witness protection program, the witness in the Reynolds case said, ""All they told us was maybe we should move."" ""I'm pretty sure I told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program. I can't remember if I gave them all the details."" the prosecutor assigned to the case, who didn't want to be named, told CNN. After Reynolds' conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home. They received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked. The couple received a death threat from Reynolds himself through the mail. Watch witness describe fear of being targeted » . Reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation. However, it is likely he'll be released within five years. No national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist, and minimal research has been conducted on the subject. The latest National Institute of Justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem. Colorado has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget. In contrast, the city of Denver spent almost $100,000 on landscaping last year. The state, on average, spends about $1,000 per witness. That figure supposedly includes moving expenses, rent, and furniture. The federal program spends in excess of $40 million per year on witness protection. One possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities, as do federal witnesses. ""It's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public's expense; it's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses,"" according to Peter Weir, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety. Colorado's witness protection program is a ""joke,"" according to The Rev. Leon Kelly, founder and executive director of the Open Door Youth Gang Alternatives. Kelly says the state doesn't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward. More than a decade ago, a young man named Darryl Givens asked Kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison. Givens chose to testify. A few months later, he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends. That day continues to haunt Kelly. Rhonda Fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son's murder. Javad Fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married. He had plans to move east when a Fourth of July barbecue in 2004 in changed all that. He witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing. Javad Fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in Aurora, Colorado. The couple, both 22, died instantly. Rhonda Fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program. She confronted prosecutors after his murder. Fields told CNN, ""I asked them what happened. Why weren't any measures taken to safeguard his life? And I was told he never asked for any protection."" Javad's mother does not think it was her son's responsibility to ask for protection. ""I think it's the authorities' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness,"" she said. Field's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program. Prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting Javad Fields' personal information be kept secret, but it wasn't signed by a judge until one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects Fields' personal information, along with crucial trial documents. ""I felt like the DA's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life,"" Rhonda Fields told CNN. District Attorney Carol Chambers maintains the program has improved. She says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena, ensuring witnesses are aware of their options. That didn't start, however, until two years after Javad Fields was killed. E-mail to a friend .",formal

I think if anything, most heavy PvPers (including Focus spec players) were expecting it to be hit with a nerf 1.4, instead it's the other way around. Everyone knows Focus Guardians (and to a lesser extent Sentinels) do the expected insane amounts of total damage (AOE spec, no big surprise) but what's crazy is that they'll often also have the biggest single hit in warzones, because of the way they can Force Stasis/Choke (skill tree node) and Leap in (Vindicator set bonus) to get extra damage + guaranteed crit (skill tree node). I'm fully augmented WH with optimized mods/enhancements and I'm lucky to hit 5.5k against BM and above opponents. I've screenshots of Guardians doing up to 6.7k in those same warzones while also surpassing me in total damage. And Bioware is buffing them so they can Smash even *more* often? It wasn't until I talked to a friend who does PvE (which I almost never do) that he explained it's a PvE buff. Focus spec lags super hard (around 15-20% according to DPS parsers) behind Vigilance for Guardians and the other 2 DPS trees for Sentinels in PvE. So they upping the frequency of Sweep to make up for this. Here's where I see 2 problems: 1) I doubt this is even gonna fix the PvE issue. A big part of Focus specs problem in PvE is the fact it's AOE and it'll wake up and hit all CC'd targets along with taking threat away from the tank that the tank might not have heavily taunted/attacked at that point. I have a feeling most dedicated PvErs are still gonna stick with the other specs because it's safer and does damage just fine. 2) I understand in PvE, Focus spec is underwhelming against a boss with 500k - 1mill-k HP. The sustain just isn't there (pre 1.4). But in PvP burst is king and against players with 15k-20k health, hitting for 5k-6.5k damage every 15 seconds against everybody around them is VERY VERY GOOD. And now it's gonna get even better. I'm just gonna go out on a limb and say next few weeks Warzones are gonna be a bit rough when more and more ppl realize how strong Focus spec is post 1.4 and until it becomes an obvious enough issue that Bioware needs to balance patch this. **TL;DR = As if Sweep/Smash spec wasn't already borderline OP in PvP, prepare to see a lot more of them come 1.4 buffs.** EDIT: Don't want to give the impression that I thought Focus spec was totally and absolutely broken. It does have weaknesses like lack of sustain and nothing to really fall back on if Smash doesn't hit (at least till the next cooldown). Also it's one of those specs that is very gear dependent, meaning with bad gear, it is very very bad because of the weaknesses above. But it's also a spec that gets exponentially better once you have awesome gear because everything is focused down to a single bursty AOE attack that automatically crits and is kinetic damage so Knights can completely ignore accuracy and crit rating and stack main stat, power, and surge (which explains the 6.7k+ hits). So again, didn't think it was broken, but did think it was a bit too strong pre 1.4. And now it's getting buffed. Sadface.jpg",informal

"Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Labour - which is opposing the cap - was ""in denial"" over the state of the economy. But Labour argued the cap would be a ""hit and run"" on working families. Benefits have historically risen in line with the rate of inflation. The Commons vote is due at 19:00 GMT. The House of Commons is debating the Welfare Benefits Uprating Bill, which would keep benefit rises to 1% for three years from next April. The coalition argues this is necessary to reduce the deficit, and is fair at a time when public sector pay is being capped and salaries in the private sector are rising below the rate of inflation. But Labour, which opposes the cap, says it will result in a real-terms cut in support for millions of working people. Some Lib Dem MPs, including David Ward, John Leech, Julian Huppert and former minister Sarah Teather, are expected to rebel against the government while others - including Julian Huppert - could abstain. Mr Leech, MP for Manchester Withington, said he found it ""objectionable that the Tories are using 'skivers versus strivers' rhetoric to justify a cut to seven million working families"". Despite the concerns of some Lib Dems, the coalition is thought likely to win the vote. Legislation is needed to implement changes announced by Chancellor George Osborne in last month's Autumn Statement - to cap increases in jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, income support and elements of housing benefit. The cap would also apply to maternity allowance, sick pay, maternity pay and paternity pay as well as the couple and lone parent elements of the working tax credit and the child element of the child tax credit. These benefits traditionally rise in line with consumer prices in an annual process known as ""uprating"". By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News Glance at the spreadsheets and the scale of the saving is apparent. Figures in the Autumn Statement show raising many benefits and tax credits by 1% a year will save £2.8bn in 2015/16, compared with the government's previous plans. The overall welfare budget in 2011/12, as calculated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is £201bn. The political debate will centre on who should feel the pain. Jobseekers Allowance totals 2.4% of the total bill, according to the IFS. Benefits for those on low incomes make up just under 21%. Those for elderly people, including the state pension, make up over 42%. The estimated value of fraud and error overpayments in benefit expenditure in 2011-12 is £3.2 billion. They increased 5.2% this year and without the planned change would have been set to rise by 2.2% - the rate of CPI inflation last September, on which the figure is calculated. The rate of inflation has since risen to 2.7%. During lively scenes in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said: ""The number one priority now is reducing the deficit that they [Labour] left us - the biggest deficit since the Second World War."" He added that the gap between the rate of income inflation between workers and the unemployed had ""grown"" in the last few years. ""These are decisions that we are not taking easily but these are circumstances that they [Labour] are in denial about,"" Mr Duncan Smith said. For Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne accused the government of presiding over an increase in unemployment. But Mr Duncan Smith said this was not the case and that the US and other European countries were faring worse than the UK. Mr Byrne said the government was showing ""contempt"" by trying to ""ram this bill through the House in just one day"". He added: ""It's turning into a hit-and-run on working families and we should not stand for it."" Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: ""Isn't the truth of this that it's a mean and miserable piece of legislation from a mean and miserable government?"" Sarah Teather, who was replaced as an education minister in last autumn's government reshuffle, said she would oppose the bill ""with a heavy heart"" because it was ""disingenuous"" to try to ""find someone to blame for our own woes"". ""A fissure already exists between the working and non-working poor,"" she told MPs. ""Hammering on that fault line with the language of 'shirkers and strivers' will have long-term impacts on public attitudes, on attitudes of one neighbour against another. ""It will make society less generous, less sympathetic, less able to co-operate."" However, Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes told the House: ""It's difficult but the government has got the right and I believe, after this parliament, it will be vindicated by getting more people in work and fewer out of work."" David Cameron's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister's view is that the welfare system has to be brought back under control. The measures that the government has been taking, ever since the government came to power, have been designed to that end."" The BBC's political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said an ""impact assessment"" published by the government suggested single parents would be most affected by the cap - losing £5 a week or about £250 over the three year period. The majority of working age households in receipt of state support are likely be an average of £3 a week worse off.",formal
"(CNN) -- The owner of a North Carolina beach house where seven college students died in a weekend fire said Monday that his family's ""lives were just changed forever"" by the tragedy. Chip Auman said his 18-year-old daughter survived the fire but was hospitalized and in stable condition because of complications from smoke inhalation. ""The thought of losing a child is unimaginable to me, and as a father my heart goes out to the families that lost a loved one in this situation,"" he said. Auman said the situation was ""hard to fathom."" ""There's just no words to describe what we've been going through,"" he said, asking for prayers for survivors and the families of those who died. ""We're numb, we're confused, we're heartbroken."" Two college campuses mourned Monday. Six University of South Carolina students and a Clemson University student died in the fire early Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. Six other South Carolina students were able to get out of the house in time. The six were treated and released from nearby Brunswick Community Hospital, but Auman's daughter was hospitalized again in Hartsville, South Carolina. Authorities from the state Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith said the house was ""engulfed"" in flames when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after being notified. The flames shot into the sky and ultimately left little more than portions of the framing. Fire officials do not believe foul play was involved. Watch a neighbor's video, fears of fast-burning fire » . Dennis A. Pruitt, the vice president for student affairs for the University of South Carolina, said investigators have said it would be Tuesday or Wednesday before the identities of the victims are confirmed publicly. It could be as much as a month until investigators know the cause of the fire, Pruitt said. The university did not cancel classes on Monday, but Pruitt said arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class at the 28,000-student campus. Pruitt said meetings had been held Sunday with members of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. The South Carolina students were affiliated with those houses, he said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. He also said counselors and ministers were available to help students deal with the loss of their classmates. The university president, Dr. Andrew Sorenson, contacted the families of those who died in the fire to express the condolences and support of the university community. Jay Laura, student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the campus would pull together after the tragedy. ""If any place can come together to help in the healing process and the aftermath of an event like this, it is South Carolina,"" Laura said at a Monday afternoon press conference. Fire survivor Tripp Wylie, a 20-year-old South Carolina sophomore, said he jumped out of a third-story window into a canal to escape the flames and was unable to get back in to help his friends. ""I could see a buddy of mine off to the left who had gotten out. He was just yelling at me to jump and stuff,"" Wylie told CNN affiliate WYFF. ""The smoke was pouring out, couldn't really breathe, so I had to make a quick decision. [I] just kind of leaned out the window and luckily I jumped far enough to make it into the canal."" Neighbors flocked to see the fire as firefighters battled and ultimately got the blaze under control. See the scenes of devastation » . George Smith, who lives across the street from the house, said he heard sirens between 6:30 and 7 a.m. and went outside to see ""the whole sky lit up."" ""The whole house was completely engulfed in flames, up to about 20 feet,"" he said. ""I have never seen [a fire] move so fast."" George Smith said the house's occupants were ""partying in there yesterday and into the night."" After about 10:30 p.m. Saturday they quieted down, he said. Linda Sing said she was walking her dog when she saw the fiery destruction. She noted that firefighters had saved an adjacent house by spraying it down with water. ""We knew there were people in there, but we hoped and prayed they'd gotten out,"" Sing said. ""This is the worst thing I've ever seen. We've had hurricanes, but this is worse.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A day after New Jersey banned executions, newly released figures show that capital punishment dropped this year to a 13-year low. The Supreme Court will hold oral arguments January 7 about the constitutionality of lethal injection protocols. Forty-two people have been put to death this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), a Washington-based group that opposes the practice. That figure is down 57 percent from what it was in 1999, when 98 inmates were executed. Next year's figures are expected to drop further. The Supreme Court is to hold oral arguments January 7 about whether lethal injection protocols in 36 of the 37 states with the death penalty are constitutional. See how the rates have dropped » . The justices placed a moratorium on executions in late September, when they decided to review a Kentucky case about whether the three-drug lethal ""cocktail"" of chemicals represents ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" since it may cause excruciating pain to inmates unable to express discomfort. Stays of executions have been issued in several states until the larger constitutional issues are addressed. If the high court finds the procedures unconstitutional, it could take years before death-penalty states would meet legal standards necessary to resume lethal injection. And even if the method is declared acceptable, it would be months before new execution dates could be set. Ten states carried out executions this year. Outside the South, Arizona, South Dakota, Indiana, and Ohio together subjected six men to lethal injection. Learn about states' death penalty policies and statistics » . Texas continues to lead the nation, with 62 percent of executions nationwide this year. Overall, 86 percent this year were in the South. No more executions are scheduled this year. ""The death penalty has been in a period of decline for many years,"" said Richard Dieter, executive director of DPIC. ""Two thousand seven will be known as the year executions came to a temporary halt and as the year of concrete legislation reconsidering the death penalty."" Death penalty supporters acknowledge that states outside the South have been reluctant to impose the punishment, even in the face of rising big-city crime rates. ""I think the main problem is that the death penalty is not being imposed often enough in those urban jurisdictions,"" said Kent Scheidegger of the Sacramento-based Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. ""I think people of the cities are not getting the quality of justice that people elsewhere receive. I think we need to build support for the death penalty and need to impose it more regularly where it is warranted."" New Jersey's legislature voted last week to outlaw the death penalty -- the first state to do so in 42 years -- and Gov. Jon Corzine signed the measure into law Monday. At the same time, he commuted the sentences of the eight men on the state's death row. The move was largely symbolic, since no executions have occurred there since 1963. Similar bills in Nebraska, New Mexico and Montana failed this year in the legislature. State lawmakers in Maryland, Colorado, North Carolina, Tennessee and California are also considering abolishing the death penalty, but no bills have been introduced. The Supreme Court on January 4 will decide whether to review an appeal from Louisiana inmate Patrick Kennedy, sentenced to death in 2003 for raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter. The state's high court upheld the punishment as appropriate. The justices in 1976 banned capital punishment for rape, but 19 years later, Louisiana passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12. State lawmakers distinguished the earlier high court case as pertaining only to ""adult women."" E-mail to a friend .",formal

"Boy Scouts really fucked up. That said, I believe that their biggest mistake was not training their leaders on mandated reporting in IL. See my email below to my family members who are active scout leaders: So, through my job and internship it has come to my attention that any recreational personnel that work with children are MANDATED REPORTERS. Per the IL DCFS website at WHO ARE MANDATED REPORTERS? Members of the general public may report suspected child abuse and neglect if they choose. However, state law mandates that workers in certain professions must make reports if they have reasonable cause to suspect abuse or neglect. Mandated reporters include: Medical Personnel: Physicians, psychiatrists, surgeons, residents, interns, dentists, dentist hygienists, medical examiners, pathologists, osteopaths, coroners, Christian Science practitioners, chiropractors, podiatrists, registered and licensed practical nurses, emergency medical technicians, substance abuse treatment personnel, hospital administrators and other personnel involved in the examination, care or treatment of patients. School and Child Care Personnel: Teachers, school personnel, educational advocates assigned to a child pursuant to the School Code, truant officers, directors and staff assistants of day care centers and nursery schools, and child care workers. Law Enforcement: Truant officers, probation officers, law enforcement officers, and field personnel of the Department of Corrections. State Agencies: Field personnel from the Departments of Children and Family Services, Public Health, Public Aid, Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities, Corrections, Human Rights, Rehabilitation Services. Also includes supervisors and administrators of general assistance under the Illinois Public Aid Code. Others: Social workers, social service administrators, substance abuse treatment personnel, domestic violence program personnel, crisis line or hotline personnel, foster parents, homemakers, **recreational program or facility personnel**, registered psychologists and assistants working under the direct supervision of a psychologist, members of the clergy. Mandated reporters who make good faith reports have the same immunity from liability under the law as non-mandated reporters. However, a mandated reporter's failure to report suspected instances of child abuse or neglect to DCFS constitutes a Class A misdemeanor; simply reporting suspicions to a superior does not satisfy legal requirements. What does this mean? It means that BY LAW you are required to report any suspected cases of child abuse or neglect. Why am I sending this out? Because I am disturbed by how neither Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts has ever covered mandated reporting in their trainings, even though you are required to be mandated reporters by law. Failure to do so could result in criminal charges and the state taking actions against the organization. Boy Scouts is certainly in a lot of trouble for failing to report child abuse in the past (see the article According to the article: The Boy Scouts of America sent reporters a news release in which they say that under current policy, ""it is mandatory that any good-faith suspicion of abuse is immediately reported to law enforcement."" However, I have yet to hear about ANY scout leader being trained on mandated reporting, so yeah. **tl;dr By IL law scout leaders are mandated reporters and by law have to report any suspected child abuse or neglect to the authorities.**",informal

For this, the problem is the only sales that counted towards the weekend were fulfilled sales (sales don't go on book until the item has changed hands, so an estimated million or two pre-orders are not counted towards this weekends sales because they ran out of product). Additionally, because Apple ran out of stock so fast, the product was not available for showcase and for immediate purchase in Apple store, which they expected limited the amount sold. The figure could have easily been 6-10million phones sold opening weekend had Apple had adequate stock. The analysts expected Apple to, but unfortunately Apple did not come through, otherwise this weekend could have been a huge stock boost which I would have loved to see. TL;DR - Analysts usually do quite well, but Apple not having enough iPhones in stock for opening weekend hurt their sales and thus caused them to come in under expectations. Edit: forgot '",informal
"(CNN) -- Rock group R.E.M. debuted a song from its upcoming album Wednesday on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360°"" program. R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe says the band was honored to be involved with the ""Planet in Peril"" project. The song ""Until the Day Is Done"" also will appear later this month in ""Planet in Peril,"" a four-hour CNN documentary that looks at environmental crises around the world. ""With 'Planet in Peril,' Anderson Cooper and his team have done an amazing job capturing global eco-devastation,"" said R.E.M singer Michael Stipe in a news release. ""The images in the film are beautiful, while at the same time heartbreaking and frightening. We are honored to have our song included in this monumental project."" This isn't the first time R.E.M. has worked with Cooper. The band premiered its video ""Bad Day"" on the show in 2002. ""Planet in Peril"" executive producer Charlie Moore said the group's longstanding commitment to environmental causes made them a natural choice for the project. Watch a trailer for ""Planet in Peril"" and hear ""Until the Day Is Done"" » . Moore said they contacted R.E.M. earlier this year to see if the group would be willing to write a song to go with the documentary, and the band happened to be in the studio working on their upcoming album. ""We were able to hear some of the stuff they were doing and this particular song fits perfectly for the project,"" Moore said. He said the group, their management and their record label were eager to be involved. ""It's sort of serendipitous that we were able to work something out with them,"" Moore said. ""All the stars were lined up for this to happen, they were in the studio, they were working on a song that fit with the feeling that the pictures portray and they really match up very well. And we like their music, we like their work and are just thrilled that they wanted to be a part of it."" ""Planet in Peril"" features CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta and ""Animal Planet"" host and wildlife biologist Jeff Corwin. The two-part documentary was filmed in 13 countries and focuses on the issues of climate change, deforestation, species loss and overpopulation. CNN will air ""Planet in Peril"" on October 23 and 24 at 9 p.m. ET. It also will be broadcast on CNN International. In a message on the R.E.M.'s Web site, the group said it had finished recording songs for the new album, which is scheduled to be released next year. The band also is releasing a live CD/DVD on Tuesday with 22-tracks recorded at a 2005 concert in Dublin, Ireland. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"On the face of it, yeah, 700 grams is a lot. But I don't think it's necessarily as bad as you might think. In fact, if you're offended by drug related crime, you should probably be in favor of casual users stock piling around that much... See, if you smoke on the regular, that much weed is still going to run out. You're not going to use 700 grams all at once, so that volume has to be judged by consumption rate and accessibility of resupply. That resin might be his absolute primo stash that he dips into on rare occasion, and if he can only resupply every 3 years.... Basically, for some smokers (all day, erry day, amiright?), 700 grams can be 'just enough' and then they are totally satisfied in terms of drug transactions for a long while. Which brings me back to crime: since we can't keep even drugs out of super max prisons, let's work under the assumption that people are still going to be able to score on occasion. Do we want lots of drug transactions with lots of hard to prosecute interactions, easy cash flow, and low costs of entry to the market combined with high investigatory costs? Or do we want an industry that requires deep pockets to play around in (providing legal surface area and related assets), is continually dealing in significant volumes (minimizing the number of players), and with a minimum number of targets to legislate, investigate, and regulate all while having a more predictable supply to minimize market opportunity to new entrants? Smokers going out and scoring here and there keeps the drug war broad and wide, and punishes responsible users who get hit with disproportionate penalties for living their lives in a more law abiding manner. And the only upside is more drug dealers who exist in an easier, more profitable, market. Home or regional growers supplying large volumes of nationally grown weed to residential users for personal use (through the mail for example), would be indistinguishable from our current drug *use* situation, but would give us a fighting chance to eliminate the violent crime aspect of prohibition. It also provides a reasonable framework for full taxation and national price competition (putting unsustainable cost pressure on illegal dealers), and can even be extended (through NAFTA), to deny *billions* of dollars every year to central and south american crime syndicates. tl;dr: middle aged white dudes who aren't sketching around in back alleys but blaze like a motherfucker when they come back from the office are gonna be prone to stockpile.

One of this year's highlights is an ""edible garden"", in which visitors can see their food growing in the ground before it gets to their plates. The aim of the garden is to encourage people to grow their own food at home. The event will also showcase the best of local livestock, with prized pigs, cattle, poultry and ponies all lining up in bid to be the stars of the show. Their owners will also get a chance to shine, with horse riding and show jumping displays along with sheep shearing competitions and awards for the best livestock breeders and handlers.

"(CNN) -- A virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the United States, researchers reported Thursday. Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some U.S. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in the United States. More than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination. Signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the United States in 2004, the same year American beekeepers started importing bees from Australia. The disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone. The virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) -- named that because it was discovered by Hebrew University researchers. Although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish, bees infected with IAPV die close to the hive, after developing shivering wings and paralysis. For some reason, the Australian bees seem to be resistant to IAPV and do not come down with symptoms. Scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that IAPV was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time. But the study released Thursday on the Science Express Web site, operated by the journal Science, cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors. ""This research give us a very good lead to follow, but we do not believe IAPV is acting alone,"" said Jeffery S. Pettis of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Bee Research Laboratory and a co-author of the study. ""Other stressors on the colony are likely involved."" This could explain why bees in Australia may be resistant to colony collapse. ""There are no cases ... in Australia at all,"" entomologist Dave Britton of the Australian Museum told the Sydney Morning Herald last month. ""It is a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon."" Bee ecology expert and University of Florida professor Jamie Ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time, pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors. Researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the U.S. mainland but are not found in Australia. University of Georgia bee researcher Keith S. Delaplane said Thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope. ""One nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind,"" said Delaplane, who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite. ""But in the case of IAPV, there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder. This is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease- and pest-resistant."" Bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees. ""The next step is to ascertain whether IAPV, alone or in concert with other factors, can induce CCD [colony collapse disorder] in healthy bees,"" said Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Besides the Columbia and USDA researchers, others involved in the study released Thursday include researchers from Pennsylvania State University, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, the University of Arizona and 454 Life Sciences.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner's declaration that France had to prepare for the possibility of war against Iran over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior. But then Kouchner was never expected to be a soft-soaper on the diplomatic scene. French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority. A surprise appointment from the Socialist ranks to Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative government, the founder of Medicins Sans Frontiers has always challenged convention and authority. The former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali once called Kouchner 'an unguided missile' and the man himself has been known to declare: ""To change the law you sometimes have to break the law"". He was in his youth one of the leaders of the students revolt in France in May 1968. Kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot, with a strong commitment to human rights. Unusually for a man of the Left, he supported the US-led intervention in Iraq (while criticizing the aftermath). But he did so on the grounds of Saddam Hussein's denial of human rights, not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction. His and President Sarkozy's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join Gordon Brown's Britain in a new push for action in Darfur. Bernard Kouchner did not come to his position with any of former President Chirac's instinctive distrust of the United States. Washington, which has been critical of some European states for their weakness in confronting Teheran, will have been delighted by his 'get serious' warning to Teheran. But the plain-speaking Kouchner is unlikely to be deterred by fears of upsetting the White House when he has criticisms to make of US policy. How much should be made of his words on Iran remains unclear at this stage. They were scarcely on the same scale as President Chirac's threat when he was still in office to retaliate with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large-scale terrorist attack on France. But they are all of a piece with France's new high-profile style under the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Kouchner, for example, became the first French Foreign Minister to visit Iraq since 1988, insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country's problems, not a military one, and offering France's services as a mediator and 'honest broker' between Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. On Iran he is, in a way, merely echoing the words of his President who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear-armed Iran would be 'unacceptable' and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as 'undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today'. Certainly Mr Kouchner is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President Chirac that a nuclear-armed Iran might be inevitable . In continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the West's resolution on Iran's nuclear enrichment program Mr Kouchner is supplementing his president's warnings. Neither is saying that military intervention against Iran is imminent or inevitable. Neither has yet confirmed that France would be part of any such military action. But both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of Teheran's brinkmanship. Perhaps the strongest lesson though from Mr Kouchner's intervention is his underlining that the new administration in France is not a knee-jerk anti-American one -- and that France is in the business of reclaiming a role at the top diplomatic tables.

Larry King, left, poses with (l-r) Paul McCartney, Yoko Ono Lennon, Olivia Harrison and Ringo Starr Tuesday in Las Vegas. ""We were just kids from Liverpool,"" McCartney said. ""And, yes, it is quite amazing, because as time goes on, it kind of becomes more and more of a phenomenon."" McCartney said the early Beatles knew they were a good band and were pretty sure of themselves, but Starr said, ""We thought we'd be really big in Liverpool."" ""I think the most exciting thing is that, you know, we expect people our age to know the music. But actually, a lot of kids know the music,"" Starr said. ""And if anything is left, we have left really good music, and that's the important part, not the moptops or whatever."" The pair appeared relaxed in sneakers and almost matching black suits and joked frequently -- often at each other's expense. ""They were nothing,"" Starr said of his former bandmates. ""And then I joined and then they got this record deal and look what happened."" ""No, we were good,"" McCartney retorted. ""You wanted to join us. You begged to join us."" ""I didn't beg,"" Starr said. Watch Paul and Ringo talk about the Beatles' magic » . McCartney and Starr were in Las Vegas with Yoko Ono Lennon and Olivia Harrison, the widows of John Lennon and George Harrison, to celebrate the anniversary of Cirque du Soleil's ""Love,"" which uses the Beatles' music. Harrison said her husband was friends with Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte and came up with the idea before he died of cancer in 2001. ""George was around just long enough to transmit that to all of us,"" Harrison said. Ono said she wasn't sure at first what her husband would have thought about the project. John Lennon was shot near the couple's New York apartment in 1980. ""Now I really know that John would be very happy with this,"" she said. Neither woman has remarried and they both said it was still sometimes difficult to deal with their losses. ""We feel so strongly about our husbands that sometimes it's hard for us, isn't it?"" Ono said. ""It's hard, you know,"" Harrison said. ""I mean their presence is very powerful and very strong. But the incredible thing about them is that they -- everything they left the world and left us is uplifting and joyful."" The Beatles' music received a bit of a facelift for the show and has been remixed in 5.1 surround sound. (An album, ""Love,"" came out last year.) ""Paul and I went to listen to the music in 5.1 and we go 'Whoa, listen to that,' "" Starr said. ""You know you can hear everything now. Things that we buried a lot. It's all very clear, so it's really great to hear it."" ""Most historic stuff goes down with age, you know?"" McCartney added.

"(CNN) -- A man named as a suspect in the fatal shooting of a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, police officer last week was captured at a shelter in Miami, Florida, on Tuesday, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson said at a news conference. Miami Police Chief John Timoney said he had been alerted by Philadelphia police that the suspect, John Lewis, had taken a Miami-bound bus from Philadelphia. Acting on information from Miami Rescue Mission, officers went to a homeless shelter where they found Lewis, ""who was pretty easy to spot as he's 6 feet, 270 pounds,"" Timoney said. He was apprehended ""unarmed and without incident,"" the Miami chief said. Timoney said it didn't appear that anyone in Miami was helping Lewis, according to CNN affiliate WPVI. Miami Police Officer Gil Gonzalez said Lewis ""had a Bible and was praying when we went to get him. He had a look of guilt, a look of shock."" Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street said people at the shelter recognized Lewis from televised photos of the suspect. Lewis is suspected in the October 31 shooting of Philadelphia Police Officer Chuck Cassidy. Cassidy was shot in the head when he inadvertently walked into a robbery in progress at a Dunkin' Donuts. He died the next day. Investigators told WPVI that Lewis was spotted on security video boarding a bus to Miami on Saturday night. Cassidy was one of three Philadelphia police officers shot in a four-day period last week. Mariano Santiago was shot in the shoulder late last Tuesday as he approached a vehicle. He is in fair condition. Officer Sandra VanHinkle was shot early last Sunday and is out of the hospital and doing well, police say. Former co-workers of Lewis who spoke to WPVI said they were surprised by the allegations against him. ""He was so nice,"" Kiani Clark told the station. ""He was really nice. He didn't seem like the type that would hurt a fly."" The Associated Press reported that Lewis had been arrested in 2005 on drug charges, which were withdrawn after he completed a treatment program. He was arrested again in June on drug charges, and that case is still pending, the AP reported. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Aurore Ankarcrona contributed to this report. Copyright 2007 CNN.

"this is going to take a long time to type.... this summer me and my best friend did some mushrooms, but these mushrooms were no ordinary mushrooms. It's was a mid summer night, and we were bored as usual, so being the type of kids we are we started looking for acid, Which is never an easy find. After three hours nothing had turned up, and we had basically lost hope on the night. Thirty more minutes rolled around and we had long since called it quits, when my other friend said he could get boomers. ""hells yeah!"" I was thinking.... early assumption. My friend comes down to my house and we pile in my car to go get them, only about a twenty minute drive, and we would be getting them from a house so it wasn't at all sketchy. We arrive, and my friend goes in to get them, my best friend and I chat in the car for about five minutes until the other friend comes back. He gets in the car and says, ""you guys are in for a wild night, these are from her personal stash, and they're not psilocybin meniscus."" To me and my best friend, this was awesome, something we had never tried, something new. Anyway we get back to my house and prepare to eat the boomers, we have a Quarter of an ounce to split, of which there was one massive stem and about eight caps. I took the stem and my best friend had the caps. I forgot to mention that these shrooms were super weird looking (for magic mushrooms) and had this weird white powder on the outside. Anyway we scarf them down, and after about eight minutes I was FUCKED up. usually shrooms take about an hour to kick in so this made me a little nervous, but I figured oh well more time to trip. we decide to go on a walk and for the whole journey everything looked like it was in pixels, and the moon looked like the sun in minecraft. we walk back to my house and go down into my basement, throw on adult swim, and converse like we always do on mushrooms. this goes on for about two hours, and is a super good time until my best friend needed to take out his contacts. Now he is really blind, so I can no longer explain what he may be seeing, but I can tell you what I saw. After getting his contacts out, he gets really quiet. This makes me sort of uncomfortable, but I'm on shrooms, so i just rationalize it to the boomers. My belly started to feel upset so I turn to my friend and say, ""want to go smoke a bowl?"" to help me calm it down. He looks at me as if I were satan himself and yells, ""NO!!!"" So being somewhat annoyed at this i went to smoke a cigarette, Finish that up and go back downstairs. I had one of those Arizona dollar fruit punches and I took a drink of it. My friend says in a really sweet voice, ""hey man can I see that?"" I say , ""sure man"" and hand it to him. He takes the can, gives it that same look he gave me, and throws it at my fireplace. Mind you I am tripping harder then I had in a long time, to me time was unfathomable, everything was making intense patterns, so I could do nothing about this but yell, ""WHAT THE FUCK MAN?!"" he just looked at me an stood up, moving towards the stairs. This freaked me out because my parents were sleeping and I did not want to wake them up being on shrooms. So I grabbed my smokes and followed him. He walks up the stairs to the main level in my house and makes a break for the upstairs, at which point I grabbed him, because I did not want him up there. But he pulled away and got upstairs, and into my room. I follow him, but am intercepted by What I saw as a Dementor wearing a pink bathrobe, but was actually my mother. The hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life was give her a hug, because to me she was trying to suck my soul out. she walks downstairs, but to me she is floating, meanwhile my friend is derping around my room. But he sees me and instantly goes straight down the stairs and has a breakdown in front of the door, I push him outside and am walking out myself when my mother says, ""what's wrong?"" to which I respond a sharp, ""NOTHING."" I close the door and my friend pulls out his pack, grabs a smoke from it, and throws both of them on the ground. he then looks up at me and asks in a snape-like tone, ""can you give me a cigarette?"" So I grab the one he dropped, put it in his mouth and light it. He proceeds to eat the cigarette, getting the whole filter in his mouth before I can pull it out. At this point, I can't take it anymore, I take him inside, get him a blanket and a pillow, say goodnight and go to my room. i spend the next five hours listening to music and watching my posters move. The next morning he Txts me asking what had happened the night before, long conversation ensued. TL;DR Did mushrooms that were too magical",informal

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Air Force is returning F-15E Strike Eagle jets to service over Iraq and Afghanistan after grounding other F-15s, the Air Force said Wednesday. The Air Force grounded models of its F-15 fleet after the crash of an older model F-15C this month. The F-15s were grounded after a crash earlier this month in Missouri of an older model that disintegrated in flight. Each F-15E must pass an inspection of critical parts on the airframe before returning to flying missions, Air Force officials said. All U.S. Air Force 224 E-model aircraft will undergo a one-time inspection of hydraulic system lines, the Air Force statement said. The longerons -- molded, metal strips of the aircraft fuselage that run from front to rear -- will also be inspected, according to the Air Force. The straps and skin panels in and around the environmental control system bay will also be examined, officials said. The Air Force would not say whether the parts being inspected were part of the problem on the aircraft that crashed. The investigation into why that plane fell apart in flight is still ongoing and Air Force officials will not say what happened until the investigation is complete, an Air Force spokesperson said. Air Force officials said the rest of the almost 500 F-15s -- older airframes than the F-15Es -- will remain grounded until the investigation offers a solution to what happened. The E-model aircraft, the youngest and most sophisticated in the F-15 inventory, is heavily used by Central Command for ground support in the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is also used for the homeland security mission over the United States known as Operation Noble Eagle. On November 3, the Air Force grounded all of its F-15s in response to a November 1 crash of a Missouri Air National Guard F-15C in Boss, Missouri. The grounding forced Central Command to use other Air Force, Navy and French fighters to fill the gaps, though Strike Eagles did fly to support troops in battle in Afghanistan as an emergency measure while they were still under grounding orders, according to Central Command reports. The plane that crashed, built in 1980, was one of the older F-15s in the fleet. The F-15E Strike Eagle is an air-to-ground and air-to-air fighter, making it more versatile than other F-15 models, which are used for only air-to-air missions. The Strike Eagle is used in Afghanistan and Iraq in its air-to-ground role, using its advanced sensors to drop bombs on targets. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"In the first half of August, 3,800 migrants arrived in the province of Quebec seeking asylum. Most are Haitians who fear they will be deported if they stay in the US. Government officials are now redoubling efforts to counteract misinformation helping bring them to Canada's doorstep. Nearly 60,000 Haitians were offered temporary protection in the US after a devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010. The Trump administration extended that temporary protection until January 2018. Canada completely lifted its own protected status for Haitians a year ago. In 2016, about 50% of all asylum claims by Haitians was rejected. On Monday, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale warned that ""people should not think that border-hopping is a desirable or productive thing to do"". Canadian diplomatic staff in the US have been trying to ""aggressively dispel the myths"" about coming to Canada circulating south of the border, including that residency is guaranteed, said Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen.

The controversial policy was introduced nationally in 1979, to slow the population growth rate. It is estimated to have prevented about 400 million births. However concerns at China's ageing population led to pressure for change. Couples who violated the one-child policy faced a variety of punishments, from fines and the loss of employment to forced abortions. Over time, the policy has been relaxed in some provinces, as demographers and sociologists raised concerns about rising social costs and falling worker numbers. The decision to allow families to have two children was designed ""to improve the balanced development of population'' and to deal with an aging population, according to the statement from the Community Party's Central Committee carried by the official Xinhua News Agency (in Chinese) on Thursday. Currently about 30% of China's population is over the age of 50. The total population of the country is around 1.36 billion. The Communist Party began formally relaxing national rules two years ago, allowing couples in which at least one of the pair is an only child to have a second child. China's one-child policy What was China's one-child policy? Trauma and sympathy shared online Correspondents say that despite the relaxation of the rules, many couples may opt to only have one child, as one-child families have become the social norm. Critics say that even a two-child policy will not boost the birth rate enough, the BBC's John Sudworth reports. And for those women who want more than two children, nor will it end the state's insistence on the right to control their fertility, he adds. ""As long as the quotas and system of surveillance remains, women still do not enjoy reproductive rights,"" Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch told AFP. I was born in 1979, the year the one-child policy was implemented. And even then, I wasn't supposed to be born. In my parents' work unit, there were also quotas for babies. By the time my mother announced her pregnancy, the quotas were all used up for the year. But kind-hearted officials decided to look the other way and allowed my birth. My would-be siblings were less lucky. As a result of the policy, my mother had to endure two abortions. Even today, she talks about 'Number Two' and 'Number Three' and what they might have been like.

The party also announced growth targets and its next five year plan.",formal

"Have you ever read Peter Singer? This is going to come as a bit of a shock to you because his perspectives can seem quite extreme particularly to someone who is used to putting human rights ahead of all other animal rights. Nevertheless, Peter Singer's approach is one of utilitarianism. The idea is that veganism is concerned with doing the least amount of harm possible. As another poster pointed out, there is no necessary opposition between the life of an animal and the life of a human, insofar as a human can eat vegetarian foods now'a'days and leave the animal alone completely. In this instance, you can minimize the harm done to an animal (by not killing it, subjecting it to cruelty, etc) without increasing the harm done to you in any material way (I mean, so what if you don't eat meat). Vegans therefore avoid animal products to minimize harm. Follow me so far? You could argue that if a chicken lives a plush and happy life, a vegan should be okay with eating eggs the chicken produces. In some cases, they ARE okay with this - I have known vegans who may selectively eat eggs if they know the farm and know the chickens were well cared for and not subjected to any harm. But this isn't about veganism, this is about abortion rights. So I can see how you could turn this back on me: how is terminating a pregnancy minimizing harm? Well this is a complicated question. For starters, consider the exemption sane pro-lifers give in instances of rape or incest. The idea here is that carrying the baby to term will be so cruel to the woman, so emotionally painful, that terminating the pregnancy is a logically acceptable answer. The woman may not be ready for parenthood, and the infant could have a difficult life because the mother lacks resources necessary to properly care for a child. Carrying the child to term could be just as cruel to the child as to the mother, as the child may not enjoy the loving support it needs to live a fulfilling life. Everyone suffers. Likewise, if the mother's life is at risk (such as ectopic pregnancy) - the woman could go on to bear HEALTHY children later in life that won't kill her. Forcing her to have a child that is guaranteed to terminate her life is not minimizing harm. The question is where to draw the line, then. Pro-choice advocates don't think that women should go out having abortions left and right. Nobody enjoys having abortions - it can be a difficult experience. But if a mother believes that having the child will be a net negative for herself and for the child - if the child is virtually guaranteed to have a difficult life because of the mother's current situation, or because it could harm the mother, because the mother did not intend to have a child and it would ruin her life to take care of the child - these might be valid reasons that having an abortion minimizes harm. Saying that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances (or only in an extremely limited subset) denies women the ability to minimize harm in some circumstances. The idea here is that state shouldn't be able to decide what is best for a woman's life, as the woman is the only one in a good position to make that call. Obviously, the preferred solution is to make access to birth control easy, to keep the public WELL EDUCATED (none of this ""abstinence is the only 100% effective method"" bullshit), and you will reduce abortions a HUGE amount. Anyway, if your ethical viewpoint is that all human life is absolutely to be protected under all circumstances, you may reach situations where your requirement of protecting human life makes people suffer greatly. Consider end-of-life care for terminal cancer patients. If the patient is in immense physical pain with no hope of recovery, would you require that they attempt to stay alive as long as possible, or would you be all right with them dying on their own terms? I'm not saying this is analogous to pregnancy, I'm just saying that there are some circumstances where an ethos that requires you to protect human life is NOT the same as protecting the QUALITY of human life. In some circumstances, a conflict might arise where the latter becomes just as important as the former, and the pro-choice argument is that the state shouldn't have a hand in deciding for someone individually. **TL;DR: Both may be attempts to minimize suffering. Protecting a life is not the same as protecting the QUALITY of a life.**",informal

"Long one, I was in Walmart, being chased by a man whom I knew was going to rape me/cause me serious bodily harm. Said Walmart became a maze and was increasingly hard to navigate, then I come upon my ex boyfriend in the yarn section (which I'm not sure exists in Walmart stores) and he refused to help me. He said, ""You deserve what is happening to you"". So I'm running out of breath, feeling terrified, knowing I'm going to be caught when I see the door and run outside. It's raining, and very dark out. Two of my professors are out in the parking lot, one is crying and staring off into the distance. I follow her gaze to see this terrible scene: A bridge over a gaping ravine has collapsed and cars are still driving off the edge and crashing into the river beneath. People are dying right before my eyes, screaming, crying. My ears are filled with a terrible screeching sound louder than any other sobbing and I'm suddenly underneath the bridge looking up. I turn around and there's a little girl laying on the river-bank, she's making the screeching sound. I can see blood everywhere but begin to panic when I can't find why she's making this horrifying noise. I place my hands beneath her head and lift her face towards mine. Her eyes are all white and completely void of life. Her mouth grows wider as she screeches and her jaw begins to unhinge. Her teeth grow into long silver spikes that pierce her lips as they grow, finally her head tears in half completely.

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Azerbaijan recently uncovered a radical Islamic terror plot against the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Baku, prompting the facility to close its doors to the public Monday, Azerbaijan and U.S. officials told CNN. The Bibi Heybat Mosque, just outside the capital Baku. As a precaution, Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday ""following security concerns nearby,"" Britain's Foreign Office said. The terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group, two U.S. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry told CNN. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details ""are still unfolding,"" and the threat ""may or may not be"" linked to the Saturday raid. ""There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the U.S. Embassy there,"" McCormack said, noting that no specific individuals were targeted. Several days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of Baku, the ministry spokesman and U.S. officials said. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Baku, the spokesman said. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said. Several others are still at large, he added. He said the terror plot also targeted Azerbaijani government buildings. The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. ""While there is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted, the U.S. Embassy encourages Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security,"" it said. Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran. McCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well. E-mail to a friend .

"I'm warning for a wall of text here. Actually there's quite a good explanation for this phenomenon. This is what we in marketing call branding. That is the creation of a brand. A brand in turn is ""A person, name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers."" This is according to the american marketing association. Now in this case it has to do with personal branding. Rein, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define a celebrity as as ”A person whose name has attention-getting, interest-riveting, profit generating value”. By using a celebrity for endorsement in campaigns you can achieve something called co-branding. That means that the name of a celebrity is used to endorse a particular politician or party. This is the same as what Nike for example does with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods for example. They use their names, big names in their particular fields, to endorse endorse different kinds of products to give them more exposure. Say that you want to sell a shoe. If you see two ads, one with just the shoe and one with Michael Jordan (or whatever celebrity you know of) you are by more or less always going to pay more attention to the one with the celebrity. Alright so now we've covered the basics. Now we are coming to word of mouth or as we are here online we are talking about word of mouse. Because of the nature of politics, by that I mean that it's an area which very few people actually know that much about and the information can be ambiguous, they look to so called opinion leaders. These opinion leaders can be more or less anyone. For example Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley,Engadget, Ray W Johnson or what ever ... someone people look to for some kind of information they are too lazy to find out themselves and which give them the information they think they need. Now say that you know jack shit about politics and you are ha huge fan of Madonna, then you'll most probably think that Madonna probably is on to something. So instead of finding stuff out yourself you vote like Madonna, because you ""know"" Madonna and you like her, so she's probably right. That means that Madonna is your opinion leader in this case. Same goes for basically all other brands, both for intangible and tangible ""products"". I could probably continue writing about this stuff all day but I think you get the picture from this. Tl;dr It's Marketing! Get affiliated with good celebrities and you can get more votes through them.",informal

"(CNN) -- A car bomb attack in Algeria has killed three people and wounded 23, the Algerian Press Service reported. An Algerian policeman stands in front of destroyed buildings in Thenia. The attack occurred Tuesday near an office housing judicial police in the city of Thenia, about 50 km (31 miles) east of the capital of Algiers, the agency said. The blast destroyed about 20 houses, and a commission has been appointed to look after the victims, the press agency said. Islamic extremists in Algeria and other North African countries have struck several times in recent years. An al Qaeda affiliate claimed responsibility last year for the deadliest attack in Algiers in 10 years, a bombing that destroyed the prime minister's headquarters and a police base, killing at least 24 people and wounding more than 220.

"COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- Democratic Sen. Barack Obama kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts Friday in Charleston, South Carolina, that unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign. Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama is competing for the black vote with Hillary Clinton. The concerts were meant to boost black voters' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar. The ensuing controversy highlighted that Obama's desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of ""change"" is not without some serious pitfalls. When the campaign announced the lineups for the three-city ""Embrace the Change!"" gospel tour last week, one name stood out to gay bloggers: Donnie McClurkin. The Grammy-award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice, and that he was ""once involved with those desires and those thoughts"" but was able to get past them through prayer. To say the least, neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. John Aravosis, a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the Web site AmericaBlog, led the charge against the Obama campaign, writing that the Illinois Democrat was ""sucking up to anti-gay bigots"" and ""giving them a stage."" When the story bubbled up into the mainstream media, it took the Obama campaign by surprise. Obama's efforts in the Palmetto State have overwhelmingly targeted African-American churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in South Carolina from rival Sen. Hillary Clinton. The campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate's faith, launching ""40 Days of Faith and Family"" in September, which used Bible study groups to tap into the black electorate. Campaigners have run three radio ads, one of which called Obama a ""Christian family man,"" that aired on gospel stations across the state. Earlier this month, Obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of Greenville, where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with Christian vocabulary, telling the crowd, to much applause, that ""I am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on Earth."" After that appearance, the Obama campaign told CNN that Republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values. ""I think that what you're seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the '90s,"" Obama said. ""At least in politics, the perception was that the Democrats were fearful of talking about faith, and on the other hand you had the Republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away."" But on Tuesday, Obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some Christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows, especially among blacks. Obama issued a statement saying, ""I strongly disagree with Reverend [Donnie] McClurkin's views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the United States,"" and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious African Americans. A September poll of African Americans in South Carolina by Winthrop University and ETV showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that ""sex between two adults of the same sex"" is ""strongly unacceptable."" Obama held a conference call Wednesday with Joe Solomonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, and announced that the Rev. Andy Sidden, an openly gay South Carolina pastor, will appear at the same event as McClurkin on Sunday in Columbia. Solomonese was not completely assuaged. ""I spoke with Senator Barack Obama today and expressed to him our community's disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with Reverend McClurkin, an anti-gay preacher who states the need to 'break the curse of homosexuality,'"" he said in a statement. ""There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkin's message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. That's a message that certainly doesn't belong on any presidential candidate's stage."" The State newspaper in Columbia reported Friday that Obama organized a conference call Thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders. After the call, the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside Sunday's concert in Columbia. Privately, Obama aides say they believe Obama is a candidate of real, transformational change, and that uproars like the McClurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences. Will Obama's refusal to kick McClurkin off the concert bill hurt him? Like many political squabbles, despite the national story, it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. And in South Carolina, where African Americans make up about half of Democratic primary-goers, voters might not have a problem with McClurkin at all. E-mail to a friend .",formal

"The EC's doubts about the arrangement were detailed in a document on Friday. The EC said that its ""preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid."" However, Amazon said it ""has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg"". ""We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here [in Luxembourg],"" it said. The Luxembourg finance ministry said: ""Luxembourg is confident that the state aid allegations in this case are without merit and will be able to convince the Commission of the legitimacy of the anticipatory decision in question and that no competitive advantage was granted,"" it said. The European Commission began a probe of the tax arrangement last year, saying that it had suspicions it broke EU rules. The Commission document, which was sent to the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October, gives its rationale for launching the investigation. The Commission said it had ""no indication"" that the tax arrangement was ""compatible with the internal market"". The current European Commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, was prime minister of Luxembourg when the deal was struck. Mr Juncker has come under pressure over claims that around 340 global companies were granted tax avoidance deals during his 18 year tenure in Luxembourg. Commission doubts over the Amazon deal included whether Luxembourg had properly looked into Amazon's ""transfer pricing"" proposals about how money would be moved between different Amazon subsidiaries. Doubts also existed about whether the country had assessed that the proposed tax regime was in line with market conditions before agreeing the deal in 2003, the European Commission document said. The Commission also had questions about how royalty payments between certain Amazon companies were calculated, and whether ""Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate the amount of the royalty"" between its Luxembourg head office company and an Amazon firm that holds shares in the head office company. ""If the royalty is exaggerated, it would unduly reduce the tax paid by Amazon in Luxembourg by shifting profits to an untaxed entity from the perspective of corporate taxation,"" the EC said. It added that Luxembourg might have been too hasty in assessing Amazon's requested arrangement before striking the deal. Luxembourg's finance ministry said it ""has provided all the information required by the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission in its investigation."" ""Among other things, detailed reports on the transfer price requested by the Commission were disclosed,"" it added. Luxembourg is also being investigated by the Commission over suspected ""sweetheart"" tax deals with the financing arm of carmaker Fiat.

"The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebels fired hundreds of rockets and shells into at least seven government-held areas late on Thursday. By Friday morning, they had made small advances, the monitoring group added. But the Syrian state news agency Sana said the assault had been repelled and more than 100 ""terrorists"" killed. Aleppo, once Syria's commercial and industrial hub, has been divided roughly in half between government-held areas in the west and rebel-controlled eastern quarters for almost three years. Fighting on the ground and government air strikes have left thousands dead, and destroyed more than 60% of the Old City, a Unesco World Heritage site. But in recent months, the rebels have driven government forces out of several areas in the countryside to the north, as well as almost all of the neighbouring province of Idlib. More than 230,000 people are believed to have been killed in Syria since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011. Some 11.5 million others - more than half of the country's population - have fled their homes. Rebels have made numerous attempts to seize key installations held by the government, but with little effect. On Thursday, 13 Islamist fighting groups and al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, came together to launch a co-ordinated assault on several fronts. A statement said the aim of the new coalition, called Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law), was ""the liberation of Aleppo and its countryside"", after which they would work with other groups to govern the city according to Islamic law. Western-backed groups also said they were taking part in the offensive, organised through a joint operations room called Fatah Halab (Conquest of Aleppo), the New York Times reported. The rebels launched simultaneous attacks on western districts of the city controlled by government forces, firing hundreds of rockets and shells, the Syrian Observatory reported. The offensive unleashed on government-held western Aleppo by Ansar al-Sharia seems to be the most serious since the battle for Aleppo began. An early test of its prospects will be one of the first apparent objectives - the loathed and feared Air Force Intelligence headquarters in Zahra, on the western edge of the city. Rebels have tried many times to capture it, and failed. The offensive has been building up for some time, following the capture of Idlib by a newly-coalesced rebel alliance, Jaish al-Fatah (Victory Army), in March. What's making the difference is that rebel groups, and their outside backers like Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which were competing in the past, now seem to be pulling together - bad news for the regime. The success of the new campaign may depend on whether Damascus is seriously determined to hang on to Aleppo. If it is, rebel progress will be slow and hard. The UK-based group said the fighting continued into the early hours of Friday and was focused on the frontline in Zahra, a heavily-defended area that houses several major security compounds. At least nine people were killed and dozens wounded by the rebel barrage, it added. The military responded with a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of rebel positions in the city, and the fighting continued for several hours. On Friday morning, military sources told Sana and Reuters news agency that the assault had been repelled and that heavy casualties had been inflicted on the rebels. The Syrian Observatory said the rebels had managed to seize some buildings in the north-western outskirts of Aleppo, but that the gains were not of strategic importance. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says that if the rebels do manage to capture all Aleppo, it would be a huge blow to the government. There have been persistent reports in recent weeks that it is preparing to give up both the northern city, and Deraa in the south, the better to defend the core areas of western Syria with the limited manpower at its disposal, he adds. But state media reported that the prime minister has just been in Aleppo, visiting front-line units and dispensing large amounts of cash to the city authorities for reconstruction and administrative expenses.",formal

"PHUKET, Thailand (CNN) -- Relatives of the 89 people killed in Sunday's plane crash in Phuket continued to arrive in the Thai resort town on Tuesday to try to identify their loved ones' remains. A Buddhist monk blesses the wreckage of One-Two-Go airline's MD-82 jet at Phuket airport on Tuesday. Most of those killed were foreign nationals, and about 36 of the bodies still have yet to be identified, according to Thailand's state-run Thai News Agency (TNA). All of the unidentified victims were foreign nationals, it reported. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said that five Americans were among those killed when the One-Two-Go jet crashed in bad weather as it landed at Phuket's airport on Sunday. U.S. officials had previously confirmed that four Americans died in the crash, and one survived. Eight British nationals are believed to have died, according to Foreign Secretary David Miliband. He said three were still in hospital, with one in a critical condition. Thailand's Public Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla said that of the 41 survivors who remain hospitalized, 38 were in stable condition and three in critical condition, according to TNA. Flight 269 was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew members when it left Bangkok for Phuket on Sunday afternoon. Nationalities of the survivors include British, American, Swedish, Iranian, Austrian, Australian, Thai, German, Irish, Italian, Israeli and Dutch, authorities said. Watch a survivor recall the fiery horror » . One man who arrived in Phuket on Tuesday from Paris described a frustrating process of trying to communicate with Thai officials in his effort to locate the remains of his brother. For some families, DNA testing may be the only way to positively identify their relatives. Meanwhile, Buddhist, Christian and Muslim leaders gathered outside Phuket's airport on Tuesday to remember those killed. The investigation into what caused the crash continues, but the strong winds and rain are a suspected factor. U.S. officials are aiding in the investigation because the aircraft -- a Boeing MD-82 -- was manufactured in the United States. One air traffic controller at Phuket airport said pilots were warned of possible wind shear, which is dramatic changes in wind speed and direction. Airport officials said that the wind at the time of the crash was 17 kilometers an hour (11 miles an hour) with stronger gusts, but no planes were delayed or diverted because of the weather conditions. The decision to land was the pilot's alone, according to Phuket's airport manager. ""Air traffic control would give weather information to pilot and warning information but the final decision is dependent on the pilot,"" Pornchai Eua-Aree said. One-Two-Go officials would not speculate on what may have happened, saying they will wait for the findings of the investigation. But they did say their aircraft were regularly checked and maintained, and denied some media reports that questioned whether the discount airline employed more inexperienced pilots for lower salaries. One-Two-Go is one of about 40 low-cost airlines operating in Asia, and the industry will be watching closely for the results of the investigation into the crash. E-mail to a friend .

"HONG KONG, China (Reuters) -- Paul Lee got his liver from an executed Chinese prisoner; Karam in Egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $5,300; in Istanbul Hakan is holding out for $30,700 for one of his kidneys. Doctors in Pakistan have been arrested for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys. They are not so unusual: a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia and the Philippines to buy a new lease of life. Lee, a 53-year-old chief subway technician in Hong Kong, was diagnosed with liver cancer in January 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread. A friend told him about a transplant hospital in China's north eastern Tianjin city and he signed up for a place. That April, he paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life. ""The hospital has connections with a lot of prisons,"" Lee told Reuters. ""Mine came from an executed prisoner from Heilongjiang. I thank the donor deeply."" The World Health Organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually, but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000. Demand for kidneys also exceeds supply, and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and ""transplant tourists"" who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living. A donor in South Africa receives $700 for a kidney compared with $30,000 in the United States. A lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on, or at least regulate, the trade. But even where the trade is banned, laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes, which are sometimes defended by vested interests. And the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient. Any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor's liver. The complications can include bleeding, infection, even death. In the transplant trade, the recipient need not worry about, for example, exposing a living relative to that risk. ""It is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you don't have to care for someone you don't know. Once you pay, it is discarded in a way, it is dispensable,"" said Luc Noel, a Geneva-based coordinator for Clinical Procedures at the World Health Organization. China recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners, saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year. Only 20,000 transplants are carried out in China each year. Of these, 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors. China defended its use of organs from executed prisoners, saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families. A transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $33,000 in China. ""What is important is the transparency, it has to be open to scrutiny ... if China makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent, that would do good,"" said the WHO's Noel. In Asia, a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs. Excluding China, Asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year, said Lo Chung-man, professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the University of Hong Kong. Pakistan, where trade in human organs is not illegal, is turning into a ""kidney bazaar"", said the chief executive of Pakistan's Kidney Foundation, Jaffar Naqvi. There are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but Naqvi said there were 13 centers in Lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys. Patients, mostly from Europe, Saudi Arabia and India, pay about 500,000 rupees ($8,500) for a new kidney, he said. Donors are paid $300 to $1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery. There is no consent in some cases. In May police arrested nine people, four of them doctors, for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations. In the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade, but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative, with no payment. Such a clause allowing ""altruistic"" organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors, Naqvi said. Stories of people selling their organs, especially kidneys, are not uncommon in Egypt, where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line. Karam, who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal, said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure. He said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 Egyptian pounds ($5,300). ""The fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds. Both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the 'donor' received,"" said Karam. He said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients' lists. Abdel-Kader Hegazy, head of the disciplinary committee at the Doctors' Union, said Egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants, making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence. ""The law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment. We at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices, but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back,"" he told Reuters. ""It is an annoying and a regrettable situation. Well-known doctors and professors are doing this. They are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values."" The union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants, with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities. But the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior Muslim religious leaders on whether Islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths. In Turkey, students, unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the Internet selling their kidneys, listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type. These would-be donors say they have had enquiries from Germany, Israel and Turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira ($38,760). Hakan, a 27-year-old security guard in Istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published, told Reuters he received five or six offers from Turkey and Germany, offering 10,000-15,000 lira ($11,600), but he's holding out for 40,000 lira. ""Of course it's frightening but there's nothing else to be done,"" he said, adding he hadn't told his wife as he knew she would object. ""I'm doing it because of my family, if I was alone it wouldn't matter. I've got two children ... there's nothing else I can do for them."" E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland. Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. ""I very quickly realized two things,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. ""One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change."" ""The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening."" He calls his discovery Warming Island. Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming. Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious. The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius). The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling. The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC. The presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. ""For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it,"" Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. ""A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming,"" he added. Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union. But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves,"" he said. ""When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming."" He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal. ""The Earth is always getting colder and warmer,"" he said. ""It's always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet."" Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained. ""We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred,"" he said. ""What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming."" Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. ""We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don't predict it,"" he said. ""We don't know what's going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty."" The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations. The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers. Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them. ""Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know,"" Schneider said. ""That it's going to warm up? I'd bet anything on that."" E-mail to a friend .",formal
"Its leader, Heinz Christian Strache, said the way postal votes were handled was among numerous irregularities. ""We are not sore losers,"" he said. ""This is about protecting the foundations of democracy."" The party's candidate was defeated by the former Green Party leader by just under 31,000 votes. The filing of the challenge was confirmed by Christian Neuwirth, a spokesman for Austria's constitutional court. The court now has four weeks to respond. If it takes the full four weeks, its findings will come just two days before the poll winner, Alexander Van der Bellen, is due to be sworn in. Is Europe lurching to the far right? Europe's nationalist surge, country by country Is populism a threat to Europe's economies? The presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but a victory for the Freedom Party could have been a springboard for success in the next parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2018. Correspondents say the legal challenge threatens to renew divisions created by the vote, which split Austria and exposed, once again, deep differences in Europe over how to deal with the migrant crisis, the economy and how to balance national interests against those of the EU. Mr Van der Bellen was declared the winner of the election the day after voting, with 50.3% of the vote against Mr Hofer's 49.7% - despite preliminary results placing the Freedom Party's Norbert Hofer slightly ahead. But the Freedom Party is alleging numerous irregularities in its 150-page submission to the constitutional court. Mr Strache says he has filed evidence that postal ballots were illegally handled in 94 of 117 district election offices, reports said, suggesting that more than 570,000 ballots could have been affected by this. The party also claims it has evidence that under-16s and foreigners were allowed to vote. ""The extent of irregularities is more than terrifying. That's why I feel obliged to challenge the result,"" Mr Strache told a news conference. ""You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to have a bad gut feeling about this whole election. Without these irregularities Mr Hofer could have become president."" The BBC's Bethany Bell in Vienna says that if the constitutional court accepts the evidence presented by Mr Strache, there could be several possible outcomes, including a partial recount or a fresh vote in affected areas. But the court will have to decide whether the law was broken and whether any possible breaches would have affected the outcome of the election.",formal
